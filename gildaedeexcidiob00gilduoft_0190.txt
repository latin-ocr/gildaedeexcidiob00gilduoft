mystery” (secundum revelationem mysterii, Vg., but revel. sacramenti in Cod.
Aug. s), etc. A meaning derived from this is common in Cyprian's writings, i.e.,
type. In the De Dominica Oratione, 34, Cyprian says that along with Daniel,
llzree young men, strong in saith, observed tlzree hours of prayer: sacramento

scilicet trinitatis. Cyprian⁷s tlcree men out of four is not more apt than the
number tlcree hundred with Gildas, yet for both, the number itself furnishes a
type or symbol.

¹ Paenitentiae medicamine. Cf. coelestis medicina, De Paenit. 1. It is
quite possible that these words may refer to penance as imposed by a priest for
sins committed after baptism, or, as might be said, in a sacramental sense.
Can. 18 of Stat. Eccl. Antiqua directs : “ut sacerdos paenitentiam imploranti
absque personae acceptione paenitentiae leges iniungat.'’ But here, in a writing
of GildaS, as we remember the peculiar penitential usages of the very next
generation, we are led to adopt another vieW. According to that vieW, this
mention of the “ remedy of penance,⁷' opens out a characteristic feature of the
history of the Church in Britain and Ireland. The Life os Columbanus (who was
a disciple of Comgall, first Abbot of Bangor) relates that when he came from
Ireland into Gaul with twelve companions, “the powerof religion had well-nigh
disappeared in that country at the time. Only the Christian saith remained, sor
tlze remedses ospemznce and the desire of mortification were scarcely to be found,
or only in a few of those places '’ (c. 11); but after the founding of the monastery
of Luxeil, it is said that “ the people from all sides flocked there for the remedz'es
ospemmce⁷' (c. 17). In both these extr-acts Jonas has the very words of Gildas
-pszem'smtm medicamenta—and they suggest to us that such a penitential
discipline as was introduced from Ireland into Gaul by Columbanus, was in the
mind of the British writer as he penned the sentence we are noticing. The
letter os Columbaniis to I'ope Gregory Ι, in which he mentions the corres-
pondence between Vinnianus and Gildas, refers to this very sin of adultery‚
