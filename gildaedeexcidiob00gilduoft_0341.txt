The Lz'fe of Gildas. 329

He took the holy child to himself, and began to teach him in
sacred literature; and seeing he excelled in outward beauty, and
was most eagerly bent upon the liberal studies, he loved him with
tender love, and strove to teach him with attentive zeal. The
5 blessed Gildas was, therefore, established under a master's training
in the school ofdivine scripture and of theliberal artS. Observing,
however, the knowledge imparted in both kinds of teaching, he
was anxious to be taught rather in the divine doctrines, 'desiring
to imitate a kind of divine contemplation, and altogether deserting
10 the reputation of man's opinion; he did not desire, however, to
follow the noble demeanour of his high birth. At that time the
champion and most active soldier of Christ, while spending his life
in a cloister, took upon him the brave weapons of obedience ; and,
putting away the habits of boyhood, he transformed the age ot
15 blooming youth to the form of old age. For, since in his early
years he had been established among the recruits of the eternal
King, he abandoned the habits of youth, he afforded, as much to
old men as to the young, very many proofs of etei-nal salvation,
regulating the habits of both periods of life. For he was distin—

devoted to watchings and prayers, devout in ineffable love, pleasant
in action, of a winning face and handsome in all his body 3 one that
had been crucified to the world, and the world to him. Now,
in the school of the above-mentioned teacher, Hildutus, a great
25 number of the sons of the nobles were taught. The more distin-
guished amongst these, as much for the nobility of their decent as
for the uprightness of their character, were Samson and Paul;
but the blessed Gildas surpassed even these men in the wonderful
keenness of his talents. Of these men, the most holy Samson was
30 afterwards Archbishop of the Britons (εἶα, Bretons), whilst Paul
presided as bishop over the Church of the Oxismi.

the archiepiscopate of the whole of Britain (i.e., Britanny‚ mid„ c. 24). M.
Duchesne says truly that the biographer represents Samson at Dol as simply
the founder of a monastery, not of an episcopate. “L'ide'e de diocese, de
parochia, ne se revelle nulle part.’' He was, as the legend goes, bishop before
he crossed the sea (Fasles episcopam, vol. ii, p. 3²51).

older detail than the biographer of Paul Aurelian. The latter speaks only of
Ldon, a name probably carried over to Britanny from caer-llcon αν lVysg in
South W'ales, as there had never been any legiones stationed in Finisterre to give
the name ; the former, by saying that Paul became the bishop of the Oxismz'
