¹ spiritus scilicet Sanctus. As usual with greater writers than he, and long·
before his time, with that striking weakness in exegesis which characteris-es so
many Patristic writings, Gildas reads the New Testament meaning of Spiritus
Sanctus into the clause of the Book of VVisdom: “a holy spirit of wisdom.”
For aulem, MSS. of Vulg. read euim.

² Et tamquam. The order of two clauses is here inverted by Gildas.
3 Deum, eorum. ang. Dominum, illerum.

⁴ Eos qni honorant. This verse 15 found twice. See p. 93,

⁵ The Vulg. readings omit c›snnes,‘ and for eius have Deus: for non, neas
for celeriter, citos for perstaS, personam cunz'nquam.
