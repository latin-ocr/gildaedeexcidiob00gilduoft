heremita Antonius1 1 orabat vir religiosissimus cilicio indutus :
quiequid dabatur ei, continuo impendebat pauperibus, Abstinebat
se a lactea dulcedine et a melle, caro fuit in odio, fontanae herbae
potius in amore, panem ordeiceum comedebat commixtum cinere,
fontanam aquam bibebat cotidie. Balnea non intrabat, quod dili· 5
gebatur a sua gente maxime. Macies apparebat in facie, quasi
quidam febricitans videbatur gravissime. Fluvialem aquam intrare
solebat2 media nocte, ubi manebat stabilitus, donec diceretur ab
ipso ter oratio dominica. His peractis repetebat suurn oratorium,
ibi exorabat genu flectendo divinam maiestatem usque diem 10
clarum. Dormiebat modice, iacebat supra petram vestitus solum-
modo una veste. Manducabat sine saturitate, satiatus 'tantum
metando praemium caeleste, caelestia praemia erant ei in desiderio.
Praecipiebat spernere, ammonebat despicere quae transeunt in 4
momento : praedicator erat clarissimus per tria regna Britanniae3: ¹5

 

¹ Heremz'lcz Antonius. Ever since the Vita Antonii, now very generally
recognised anew as the work of Athanasius, had become known in the West,
Antony stood prominent as the ideal hermit. This was particularly the case in
the British churcheS, where the Egyptian form of the cloister life also, as founded
by Paehomius, was held in highest veneration. But this representation of
Gildas as an eremite is inconsistent with the previous reference to his work as
a teacher ; at this stage it seems a purely legendary addition.

2 Flu-wialan aquam intrare solebat. This particular way of making the
subjugation of the body excessively severe is very commonly narrated in the
account given of Celtic asceticism. We must regard it as so common a
characteristic, that any biographer felt it just to introduce it into his narrative.
The Hymn of St. Fiace says of St. Patrick (Liber Hymnorum, ii, p. 33, vv,
27, 30, 31) 3—

“ Cold of weather did not keep him from sleeping at night in pools,
He sings one hundred psalms each night to an angel’s King whom he
served.

He sleeps on a bare stone thereafter, with a damp mantle around hirn.”

So also the Homily on him in the Leablzar Breac: “ In the second watch he
used to be in cold water ; the third watch in contemplation ; the fourth watch
on bare clay, with a stone under his head, and a wet mantle around him '³
(Trifiarllle Life, p. 485). The Visa ll, 9 of Comgall, relates how he and seven
brethren retii-ed to lead an eremite life, and that the seven died in consequence
os the severities imposed upon them and himself by the saint.

Beda describes an lrish monk in North Britain, who would stand in the
River 'I‘weed with the water up to his loins and sometimes to his neck (usque
ad collum), going over his psalms and prayers ; when the bystanders, as they
saw him letting the wet clothes (lry on his body, wondered that he could bear
such cold, he suavely answered Frtgidiora ego vidi; and when they questioned
the severity he was willing to undergo, again gave answer, Austeriora ego vidi.
