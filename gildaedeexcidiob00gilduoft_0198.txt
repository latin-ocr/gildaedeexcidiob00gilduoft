Quis vestrum, ut sanctus martyr Ignatius Antiochiae urbis epis- 74

fullonis suste ..... in cerebro percussus interiit,- such are the words of
Jerome, corresponding exactly to those of Gildas, with the exception offuste
for vecte, which is also found in Rufinus, who writes: Et zmus ex ipsis fullo,

arrepto fuste, etc. That James was the first bishop of Jerusalem, or in any
way bishop, is not mentioned in the New Testament, where he is only known

as “apostle,⁷⁷ and, probably, an apostle holding some unique relation to that
Church. Neither is this mentioned by Clement, as quoted by Eusebius ; but
Hegesippus, who about A.D. 156 travelled from Asia Minor by way of Corinth
to Rome, and there devoted himself to draw up a list of the succession of
bishops (Eus, H. E„ iv, 22, 3), mentions the tradition. “Suscepit ecclesiam
Hierosolymae post apostolos frater Domini, Iacobus, cognomento Justus'’
(jerorne, from Euseb.‚ H. E, ii, 23, 4). Gildas, no doubt, records the universal
belief of his own age.

¹ Protomtm'ster. Koffmanne (Gesclz. d. lx't‘rcllclllcztcins, 34) mentions a
number of similar hybrid words, showing the influence of Greek upon eccle-
siastieal Latin, eg„ protoplastus, protolapsus, prl'llzlgelzcxr being an instance
of a contrary (lirection : ministerzdiaconus.

² lnvcrssspedibus. (iildas, in his mention os this mode of crucifixion, is
following again tlie familiar belief of his time. He may have read of it in the
He virts illustribus of Jerome, or in Rufinus.

³ Clas*it-alarius ille. The use of this epithet almost leads one to the
supposition that (iildas was acquainted with representations‚ mural or other-
wise, of l'eter bearing the keys. Krauss⁷s lfeczl-lim‘ycl. informs us that the
