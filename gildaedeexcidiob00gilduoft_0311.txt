as “ Old-Welsh Glosses’' in Zeuss's Grammatica Celtica. They were also
printed with notes by Dr. John Rhys, in vol. i of Revue Cellique, and aster-
wards with fresh notes in vol. xiii ofthe same RevieW. Following ahint given
in vol. v of the CollectedPapers ofthe late M r. Henry Bradshaw, and a notice
in vol. v ofthe Revue Celtique, by M. J. Loth, in reference to “Le Manuscrit
Latin 11411, dela Bibliotheque Nationale,’' which he said contained <on
feuillets 100, 101, et 102) some British glosses, Zimmer has succeeded in

proving that the leaves referred to belong to the same book as the Luxem-
burg Fragment. The whole, with a most elaborate discussion of their

contentS, have been published by him in the chclzriclzlen von der Kb'mgrl.
Gesellsclzaft der Wzksenschasten zu Gidtingen, 1895, Heft 2. Another
important contribution relative to this Fragment and the Hzlvperz'ca Famina

will be found in Mr. Bradshaw's Collected Ραβενς, mentioned above,
Appendix, p. 453: An Account os Investzgqations among early Welslt,

Brelon, and Corm'slz ΔΙψίοτηιιεῑνὶρίς, 1872-77 (n.b. pp. 463 ff.>.

3. The St. Orner MS. This contains a piece of Christian poetry, each
strophe of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet. A notice of
it by Thurneysen appears in vol. xi of the Revue Cellique.

These three pieceS, the Hz'sperica Famma, the Luxemburg
Fragment, and the Hymn of St. Omer, have certain peculiarities
of Latinity in common: peculiarities also that are very evident in
the Lorica osz'ldas. From such a striking fact it is not strange
that a common source os origin has been concluded for the four
compositions.' There is general agreement that they are Celtic;
but then follows the difficult question—Are they British or
Irish? Another fact that has a bearing of no small importance
upon the question is this: the Luxemburg Fragment and the
St. Omer Hymn exhibit a great number of glosses‚ many in Latin
but a good number in Old-Welsh, as explained by Rhys, Zimmer,
and Thurneysen. It should be added that Mr. BradshaW‚ in the
Appendix referred to above, regards the glosses in the Luxemburg
Fragment as Armorican ; so also does Dr. Stokes in vol. iv of the
Revue Celtique, though, when he published this Lorica from the
Leablzar Breac he pronounced them to be Old-welsh. But it
might be well to quote a few suggestive verses, for which purpose
Ι use Zimmer’s text in the Naclzriclzten. The interlineal glosses
are printed in italics‚ along with certain words in the text.
