five hundred quotations, which agree with the Vulgate reading just in a few
words only.’' These words are ofinterest, as being about the earliest recognition,
by an English writer, of the difference between the Latin Bible before Jerorne
and after.

As we examine the lengthy continuous extracts made from the Old Testa-
ment books, particularly the Minor Prophets, we are struck by the close and
literal similarity they show to the Greek of the LXX. If we compare the form
in which the same passages are given, for instance, in the Versio Antiqua of
Sabatier (frequently culled from the exegetical works of Jerome, or from the
quotations made by early Latin writers, such as Cyprian, Tertullian, the Latin
translator of Irenaeus, and Lucifer of Cagliari), we find that the words, as
quoted by Gildas, present a more literal rendering of the Greek original. A
passage already referred to, Hosea viii, 4, may serve as an example. In Sabatier⁷s
text of the old version we read : Ex semetipsis regnaverunt el mm per me,
principes exstiterunt et non indicaverzmt mz'lzz' ; the Greek is : ἑαυτοῖς
ἐβασίλευσαν, καὶ οὐ δῖ ἐμοῦ, ἧρξαν καὶ οὐκ ἐγνώρισαν μοι, for which Gildas has :
Sibi regnaverunt, et mm per me; tenuerunt principatum, nec me agnoverunt.
The Greek original of his exemplar seems to have read ἐγνώρισάν με where we
are furnished with an instance of γνωρίζειν in the rare meaning of “to know,'’

as in Phil. i, 22. Cyprian quotes the first part of the same verse twice in the ·

Epp, pp. 672 and 739 (Hartell’s edition) as follows : sibimet ipsis regem 6072-
stz'luermzf et 7207] per me, which is closely similar to Gildas here and in c. 109 :
fecerim! sibi reges el που per me. This fact of agreement with Cyprian’s quo-
tations, of which a great many instances will be found, strongly confirms the
natural conclusion that Gildas had before him codices of a very ancient rude
version made from the LXX Greek, and intimating varieties of reading even in
that. In the book of Amos, one finds Gildas differing widely from the Versz'o
Antiqua of Sabatier 3 but here a discovery made by Ranke comes to our aid.
Ranke in 1888 published fragments of Amos, Ezekiel and Daniel* from an
Old Latin Codex, of which the fragment of Amos agrees almost word for word
with the quotation made by Gildas from that prophet. This fact proves that
Ranke’s fragment and Gildas⁷ codex may have had a common original.

2. We now ask the question, how this, at first sight, unique resemblance of
Gildas’ quotations to the Greek of the LXX, is to be explained. A theory
in explanation of this fact was advanced first of all by Scholl in his De
Eccles. Brilomcm Scoforumque Historice Fonliblcs, p. 17. Ι quote his words:
“ He (Gildas) translates numerous places both of the Old Testament
and the New from the Greek. The Minor Prophets he has rendered from
the LXX version more accuralely than others (the italics are Schffll’s, accuratius
quam aliz· reddidit). The codex of the LXX used by him agrees for the
most part with Codex Vaticanus (B), but frequently comes closer to Codex
Alexandrinus (A), and occasionally, he apparently had a text which is
extant in neither (cf. Ezekiel, vii, 23; 2, 10; Hosea, viii, 13 Micah iii, ix, 5;
7, 1, vii, et aL). From which we may gather that the Codex of the LXX which
Gildas had, was different from the Alexandrinus and Vaticanus ......
