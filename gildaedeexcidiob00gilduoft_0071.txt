T lze Ruin of Britain. 59

the mountains and killed in heaps. Others, overcome by hunger,
came and yielded themselves to the enemies‚ to be their slaves for
ever, if they were not instantly slain, which was equivalent to the
highest service. Others repaired to parts beyond the sea, with

5 strong lamentation, as if, instead of the oarsman's call, singing thus
beneath the swelling sails:

of any given church); caer <a fortified place, and, simply, a village>3 llan (a
monastery, generally, then a church), etc. The terminations are equally
distinct. The Britons do not derive names of places in —acmn (aze) from names
of persons, a formation very frequent in a Gallo-Roman country. ln a word,
throughout the zone occupied by the immigrants, all is transformed‚ all is Celtic
(Brito-Celtic> : we are in Britannia ; at Rennes and at Nantes we are in
Romania ⁷⁷ (p. 84). This account of the fact that a Brito-Celtic people are found
settled on the peninsula which forms the extremity ofthe “tractus Armoricanus,’'
about the middle of the sixth century, is amplified by M. Loth. He notices at
length the special characteristics of different Celtic languages, which make it
impossible for us to regard the people of Britanny as a portion of the old Celtic
inhabitants of Gaul surviving there : reference is made to the use of Britannia,
eto, by Gregory of Tours in the Historia Francorum, to ancient Lives of SaintS,
which describe their crossing over from Britain to Lesser Britain (Britannia
Minor> with crowds of companions, and to a large bulk of historic matter in
ancient annalists and poetry. Taking all things together, a host of lines con-
verge upon one fact: that froin about A.D. 500 to 590 there was a strong stream
of emigration to the continent. It had, probably, begun earlier, and it continued
later, but during the whole lifetime of Gildas there were periods of emigration.
Two of his old sellow-disciples, Samson and Paul Aurelian, left their native
land and settled in Britany. (Vide L'Emigration bretonne en Arnzoriqne, par
J. Lotlz. 1883.)

2 Celeumatis vice. In a copious note on κέλευσμα (or κέλευμα, 3 later form) by
Blomfield‚ Glossarium in' Persas (Aesch.), p. 151, v, 403, which gives apt illustra-
tive passages as to the meaning of the Greek word, Isidore is quoted : Aliter,-
celeuma est carmen qnod rzavzgmnes canere solent, vel clamor nanticus, id est,
vox nautarum. Celemna in this passage of Gildas has a similar meaning,
implying the sailors'joyous song when at work, or in nearing port. Jemme,
Epp. 14, 10, shows this meaning well : e.27>a72de72da vela sant ventz‘s, et qnaes-
tz'onnnz scopulis transvadatis lactantium inme nautarum epilogi celeuma
cantandmn est.
