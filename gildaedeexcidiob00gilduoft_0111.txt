Tloe Ram of Bruain. 99

Toledo (died 667), give lists which place the book in the same order. One
codex, written about the time when Gildas lived, in a list of N.T. books, places
it between ad Titum and ad Filimoncm .· this is the Codex Claromontanus.

3. It will be noticed that Gildas reckons Solomon as a prophet, but, what is
more significant for us, he also ascribes to him four books, that is, Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes, (Song of Songs is not quoted), IVi'sclonl, Ecclesz'asncus. Here
again we find the influence of pre-Vulgate traditions, for if he had been
acquainted with Jerome's Pratssztzb in Libros Salomonis, as he certainly was
with the preface to Jeremiah, he could never have spoken of &Visdom and
Ecclesiasticus as works of Solomon. Fertur et Panaerelos lesu filii Siracli
liber, et alius pseudepigraplzus, qui Sapientia Salomonis inscribitur. Secundus
apud Hebraeos nunquam est. . . . el nonnulli scriptorum veterum hunc esse

Iudaei Philonis (firmant. (See note, cc. 63, 64.)

It is difficult to say how far Gildas would have treated these two books,
together with the book of Esdras, as Scripture, had he known anything of
Jerome's view respecting the Hebrew Canon 3 at any rate Esdras and Eccle-
siasticus are to him “scripture’' of equal authority with any one of the prophetical
books. Throughout, we are led to conclude, by every line of observation, that
Gildas, though appreciating and sharing in the diffusion of so new an element
in church life as a New Version of its Bible, is, nevertheless a man of the “old
school.''

33 The first to meet us is Samuel, who by the command of God
founded a legitimate kingdom, a man dedicated to God before his
birth, a true prophet to all the people of Israel from Dan to Beer-
sheba, known by indubitably wonderful signS. From his mouth

5the Holy Spirit thundered to all the powers of the world, when
denouncing Saul, the first king of the Hebrews, for the simple
reason that he had not fulfilled certain commands of the Lord.
His words are: Tltou least done foolisllly, nor llast ileon kept ille 1 Sam. xiii, 13,

then is there like to the crimes of this time? Did 116 commit

adultery or murder? Not at all. He, however, made a partial

change of the command, because, as one os ourselves has well said,

15 “the question is not respecting the kind of sin, but respecting the

transgression of a command.'' And when 116 was attempting to

 

² Quidam nostrum. Cf. 6. 62 z ui qnidam unse nos ai& and c. 92, sicut hene
quidam nostrorum ait. Gildas seems to be quoting from some Eritish writer
or writers. It would be extremely interesting to discover what man or men he
thus designates as “ one of ourselves.⁷’
