90 De Excidio Brilarmiae.

brother—is still preserved in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. lt took,
however, two centuries or more for the new translation to win general accept-
ance as also the name, hitherto borne by the old, of Vulgata versio, or, as
generally termed, the Vulgate. Now we find, notwithstanding the terrible
sufferings of those years in Britain, from 407 to 447, and from the Saxon
invasion in the last—named year, or thereabout, to c. 540, when Gildas wrote
the present work, that the new version of the Latin Bible had been silently
making its way into somewhat general use here. This, however, is only par-
tially true, and the fact leads us to speak briefiy of the old version that was
gradually being supplanted. We shall use the name now generally accepted,
in England at least, and call it Old Latin.

The Old Latin version of the Old and New Testament was made some time
during the second century ; but, after all the inquiries of modern times,
surprising in their newness and extent, there is still a cloud of darkness over-
lying the origin of this version. Probability inclines towards the opinion that
it was first made in Proconsular Africa, and Gregory holds that if we assume
such a primitive African version, there is no need to seek a double or treble
origin. ‘⁶ It arose,'' he says, ‘⁶ slowly, not suddenly, or by the command of any
bishop.''

Others would say that the version was made in dzffirent places, above all
in Africa, and by dzfferent men, but almost all are agreed that it must have
been in use early in the second half of the second century. Nestle quotes the
saying of Augustin (c. 400) : ‘⁶ Those who translated the Scriptures from
Hebrew into Greek can be counted (the LXX), but the Latin translators can in
no wise be numbered.⁷' One leading point for our notice here, however, is that
this translation was made from the Greek version of the LXX, in the Old Testa-
menn* But we must remember that the Greek of the LXX was not exactly
that which we now read as the Septuagint. This, even in its best form, is an
emended text. Origen (died 254), in his Hexaplcz, produced a text into which
he introduced many emendations, and it is his text mainly that we have in our
oldest MSS. Thus the LXX Greek, from which the Old Latin was first trans-
lated, is not before us in any edition : what we possess is a “ revised and com-
posite text ’² which in time became again the basis ofa mixed Old Latin. Let
us take the Book of Job, for example, where we know, from Origen's own
testimony, taken with that of Jerome, there were about seven hundred lines
wanting in the old LXX ; these Origen supplied from another version, that of
Theodotion, adding asterisks to mark the lines so supplemented. The asterisks
were reproduced by Jerome in the revision which he made by the help of the
LXX, and the lines so marked may be distinguished in the italicized lines of
Sabatier‘s Bibl. Sacr. Lzzll‘tme Vens-[ones Antiquae, reprinted from Martianay's
edition of Jerome, or in the reprint of Martianay’s edition given in Magne
(Tom. xxix, 61), with obell'and asterisks appended. Three groups of authorities
that have preserved these asterisks, are mentioned by Dr. Hatch in ch. vi,
