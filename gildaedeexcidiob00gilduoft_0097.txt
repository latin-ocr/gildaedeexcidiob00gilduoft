The Ruin of Britain. 8 5

earnestly exhorts the sinner to repentance in this passage: And serem· ”²³³³ss-
if that nation repent of its sin, Ι also shall repent respecting the evil
which J spahe to do nuto it. Again: Wlm will give them such ast'gtgs' xxxii,
heart that they may hear me, aud keep my praepa, aud it may

Deuteronomy, he says : They are a people void of couusel aud 9⁶35·- xxxii, ²3·

foresaw their last end! how one shall chase a thousand aud two
put teu thousand to ssight. Again, in the gospel, the Lord says1⁴1l1ut.xi,28-29.

For if thou hear these things with deas ears, thou contemnest
the prophets, thou despisest Christ, and sne, though a man of the

any rate I keep that word of the prophet with sincere godliness

exaudivit me de ventre inserui (Jonah, ii, 3), in the Latin version of Irenaeus:
descendam . . . . in infernum (εἷς ᾅδου), Gen. xxxvii, 35. Its W‘elsh deriva-
tive, zff’rn, is employed with the same meaning in most places of the authorised
Old and Nexv Testament. But it was used also as a name for a place of punish-
ment (locus suppliciorum atque cruciatorum, Jerome in Is. xiv, 7-11), and
Jerome understood the words of the creed, descendit ad infirma, in this sense.
Cyprian seems to have used inseri only, while inferus appears a few times in
the Latin Bible, eg„ Rev. vi, 8, et ilfferus (ὁ ᾅδης) sequebatur eum, where the
Welsh version has iffru, the English hell. Tartarus, though not so frequently
found, is employed for “hell '⁷ as early as Tertullian, and in the letter of Roman
presbyters to Cyprian : parauit caelum sea' parauit et tartarum, Ep„ xxx, 7. It
is evident that neither inferi nor tartarus were in common use, because infirnus
has given enser to the French language and zfflru, or yffi’rn, to Welsh. Cornish
and Armorican have allied forms, isara, yffizru; zffi‘ru, z'veru.
