64 So far, Ι have argued with the kings of my country no less
by oracles of prophets than by my own words, desiring that they
should know what the prophet had said: Flee from sins, he says, Ecclzcs. xxi, 2,

65 How gladly, in this place, as one tossed by the waves of the
sea, and carried into the desired haven by the 0315, would Ι, under
the prompting of modesty, take my rest, did I not 566 mountains so
great, and of such a kind, of the evil committed by bishops or the

late Latin writers vel has frequently the meaning of el, e.g., Fulgentius (profici.
calla, p. 537) quotes Rev. xix, 16 ε et habebat in vestimento vel (in Greek καὶ)
