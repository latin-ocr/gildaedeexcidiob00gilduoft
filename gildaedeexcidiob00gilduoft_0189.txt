The Ruin of Britain. 1 77

pots, whilst he was punished by the same anger leading to death
as his sons were? Who, I ask, of those men was killed, as Abel, Gen. iv.
owing to envy of a better sacrifice, and one carried by celestial
fire into heaven? They are men who even reject the reproof of
5 a lowly word—who lcatli Izated tlze counsel of tlze maliciam and laatlz Psalms xxvi, 5,

not sat witlz tlze ungodly, so that of him it might be truly said as of 9-
Enoch : Enoch walked witlz God and was notsozmd, that is to say, Gen. v, 24,
was not found to have abandoned God, and to limp readily after
idols at that time, amid the vanity of the whole world in its un-
10 wisdom. Who of them has refused to admit into the ark of salva-
tion, that is, now, the Church, any adversary of God, as Noah in the
time of the deluge, so that it may be made clearly manifest that
only the innocent, or those pre-eminently penitent, ought to be
in the Lord's house? Who, like Melchisedek, offered, sacrificed, Gen. xiv, 14

just man, they vanquish the dangerous armies of the five kings and

Philon, de Clement, d'Origene nous font sourire 3 elle ne nous paraissent guere
plus raisonnables que celles des stoiciens dont Cicero nous a donne quelques
echantillons si curieux dans son De Natura Deorum, Et cependant‚ il faut le
reconnaitre, cette methode se justifie par les services qu’elle a rendus” (De Faye,
Clement &Alea-andrie, p. 209). Rich thoughts were conveyed even by this
inadmissible method 3 as De Faye further says : ‘⁶ Elle a ete un instrument de
progress veritable.'' Through the writings of such men as Jerome and
Augustine‚ this method of interpretation became the accepted way for all. In
the next generation after Gildas, Pope Gregory the Great, in Homil. xxi, finds
the facts of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in what the Book of
Judges relates about Samson (illius facta significant). Samson signifies our
Redeemer, Gaza means infernum. “Samson vero media nocte non solum exiit,
sed etiam portas tulit: quia videlicet Redemptor noster ante lucem resurgens
non solum liber de inferno exiit, sed et ipsa etiam inferni claustra destruxit.''
The same in Hom. xl, shows a saner mind than Gildas: “ In the words of
Holy Writ we must first preserve the truth of history, and then seek out the
spiritual meaning of the allegory.'²

For Gildas, in common with such men before and after him, there is in every
narrative a symbolical meaning (tropicus sensus), a moral signification (moralis
intelligentia), a way of interpreting moraliy (moraliter interpretari). Hidden
meanings are thus found in very odd places, as the present chapters show.

2 Hoc est trinitatis sacramento, that is, as a type of the T rinity. The
leading meaning of the word scleralllelztmll is mystery, and Gildas has in the
next section mysterium trinitatis. With this signification it still holds its place
in the Vulgate, eg„ Ι Tim. iii, 16, “great is the mystery of godliness'' (pietatis
sacramentum) : Eph. i, 9, “having made known to us the mystery of his will''
(sacramentum voluntatis suae): Rom. xvi, 25, “ according to the revelation of the
