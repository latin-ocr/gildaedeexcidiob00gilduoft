to betoken a 813511 011 1116 11311 of the writer of the true need of the time. 1116
566 two distinct classes, and a glimpse is afforded us of a third. There are
first of all the dissolute and simoniacal men, who aim at the bishop's office
from avarice (vas episcopalium magnopere avaritiae gratia stipitis), insipientes
pastores, pastores imperiti, fizlsi sacerdotes, inertes sacerdotes, dolosi doctores,
pravi antistites, inordinati sacerdotes. We are bound to remember that zealot
no less than cynic is apt to exaggerate ; and so we have left us a corner for a
8611610115 doubt, whether, after all, spiritual affairs were quite so bad as they
are pictured by the writer. But it is when we turn to the second class that we
find the real Gildas. One could have wished that he had worked it out to
clearer issue. These are those against whom no charge can be made, upon the
score of schism, or supercilious pride, or uncleanness of life. Now while the
matter of his invective against these good men is, of necessity, different from
that against the bad priests of his time, it is, nevertheless, quite as severe.
To him they were the indolent good, and no lenity is admissible in their 6356 ;
there is 3 disdainful tone in his 111611811311011 against them. But his long clumsy
sentences took effect 3 116 11361 suggested a deep great need—the need of devoted
earnestness, of severer “ rigour and vigour,'' 31161 when the new spirit came, it
found a new way in a revived monasticism of a peculiarly Celtic stamp.

Of such 316 1116 111611 who have obtained “the apostolic chair '' in a regular way
(legitime, logitimus pastor) 3 Gildas, apparently, was a good canonist‚ though
his language was so unrestrained. They are 1116 80061 31161 experienced 11351015
(pastor peritus), men skilled to dispense spiritual food (spiritalia cibaria) for
their Lord's household. These are the true priests, and he will not deny that
they are numerous, even “in the present times⁷' (c. 92).

4. A pernsal of this part leads to other conclusions not devoid of interest. In
the first place, the general tenor of it leaves upon the mind the impression that
the whole country was Cliristianssat least in name. No charge is made
against the clergy that would lead us to infer any connection with non-Christian
or anti-Christian usages 3 as in the former part the princes are Christians, one
of them having been a monk, 50 11616 1116 clergy are ministers of a Christian
people. We find confirmation of this in the early traditions of the kings and
magnates who, accompanied by numerous bishops and clergy, 611118131661 10

In c. 67 Gildas describes how 111611 who failed to secure ordination in the
church (parochio) in which they sought the episcopal honour, were, never-
