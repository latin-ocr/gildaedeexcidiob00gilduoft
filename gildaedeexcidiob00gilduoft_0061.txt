that saying of Philo goes: we must slave rccourse [0 divine aid
where humansaz'ls. The boldness of the enemy quieted sor a time,
but not the wickedness of our people 3 the enemy withorew from
our countryrnen, but our countrymen withdrew not from their sins.

2 Ι It was the invariable habit of the race, as it is also now, to bo
weak in repelling the missiles of enemies, though strong to bear civil
strifes and the burdens of sins; weak, I say, to follow ensigns es
peace and truth, yet strong sor crimes and falsehood. The shan‘le-⁴
less Irish assassins, therefore, went back to their homes, to return

10 again before long. It was then, for the first time, in the further—
most part of the island, that the Picts commenced their successive
settlements, with frequent pillaging and devastation. „

During such truces, consequently, the ugly scar is healed for thei-sl
deserted people. While another more poisonous hunger was silently

15 growing on the other hand, and the devastation quieting down,
the island was becoming rich with so many resources of affluence
that no age remembered the possession of such afterwards : along
with these resources of every kind, luxury also grew. It grew,
in fact, with strong root, so that it might fitly be said at that same

gentiles But it was not this vice alone that grew, but also all to

which human nat-ure is generally liable : especially the vice which
to-day also overthrows the place that appertains to all good in the
island, that is to say, hatred of truth together with those who

25 defend it, love of falsehood together with its fabricators, under-

taking evil for good, respect for wickedness rather than for kind-
ness, desire of darkness in preference to the sun, the welcoming of
Satan as cm angel of [ᾖς-Ἀκί. Kings were anointed, not in the ΙΙ Cor. xi, 14.

² It is impossible to tell what amount os definite fact there may be in this
description of prosperity and moral decay. Though the style makes us sus-
picions, yet as the years of plenty were subsequent to 446, the old men of
(Jildas' childhood and youth must have moved in the lix-ing tradition of them.
