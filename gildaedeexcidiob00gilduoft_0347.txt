The Life of Gildas. 335

6 Now, St. Gildas‚ having tarried for the space of some years
under the instruction of St. Hildutus, and having been excellently
taught by him cverything that the divine goodness had entrusted
to him, both in secular writings, as far as the subject demanded, and

5 in divine writings, bade farewell to his pious master and his vener-
able fellow-disciples² and proceeded to Iren that, as a diligent
inquires, he might also ascertain the views of other teachers both
in philosophy and divinity. When, therefore, he had passed
through the schools of a great number of teachers‚ and, like a most

10 sagacious bee, had collected the juices from various flowers, he
hid himself in the bcehive of the mother church, so that, in the
suitable time, he might pour forth the mellifluous words of the
Gospel to call back the people to the celestial joys, and, as a good
servant, pay back with profit to his master the talent entrusted to

15 him. And so, following the apostle’s idea, that, while prcaclzing 1 Cor. ix·27
to others, lae should himself not be found rejected, he used to
buffet his body in fastings and watchings, spending the nights in
prayers, standing without any support on which to rest himself.

7 From the fifteenth year of his age through the whole period

20 of the present life which hc lived in this world, up to the very last
day on which he was called by the Lord, it was only three times
in the weck, as we have learnt from a trustworthy source, that he
took a most scanty food for his body. For any prudent man
whatever may assert without hesitation about him that, although

25 the sword of the persecutor failed him, he did not, however, lose
the martyr's palm. For while he buffetted his body with frequent
fastings and with protracted vigils, while day and night, even when
devoting himself to prayers, he withstood vices, while he struggled

 

discendi gratia 3 after remaining there three years he returns with a large
following of Irish clerics, among whom were Finian and Gnavan <Vita S.
cadoci, cc. 7, 8). Cybi also resorted to Ireland‚ remaining there four years
(Vita S. Kebii, p. 184 of Cambro-Britislz Sainls). That this usage was common
in the eleventh century, we know from the account given of Sulyen the W'ise
by his son Ieuan, how, following the example of the fathers, he went to the
learned Irish, moved thereto by his love of reading (see p. 298, n. 1). But that
Ireland should be sought by Gildas in his youth is extremelyimprobable, if not
impossible, because the learned Ireland‚ which drew and welcomed many to

its hospitable monasteries, had yet to be created. The change was, in fact
begun by men who were themselves disciples of Gildas, David, and their fellows

2 lnpopulos. All the Vitae agree in representing the disciples of Illtud
as pre-eminently preachers “to the people.⁷’ In the quotation which follows,
the Vulgate reads nesarle cum aliis . . . . reprobus efficiat.
