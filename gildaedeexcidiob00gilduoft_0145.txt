book of Esdras is the so-called 3 Esdras, or 1 Esdras of the English Apocrypha,
while the second book contains the Ezra and Nehemiah of our Authorised
Version. After naming the twenty-two books he adds: “whatever is outside
these must be placed among the ‹zpocrypha.²² “Nevertheless, Jerome,⁷⁷ as
Buhl says, “was not in a position to inaintain this standpoint over against the
practice of the Church, but repeatedly falls back into the inediating practice of
the Greeks. Indeed, he translated from the Apocrypha, and that entirely in
consequence of the demands of his fellow-countrymen, only Tobit, Judith‚ and
the additions to Esther and Daniel, these latter writings being distinguished
from the canonical by diacritical marks ; but in the Prologue to the ‘Books of
Solomon' 116 gives the non-canonical writings used in the Church the same
interinediate place which they held among the Greeks, while he remarks of
Jesus Sirach and of the Book of Wisdom : ‘ These two voluines it (the Church)
reads for the edification of the people, not for the establishing of ecclesiastical
doctrines ;' and so he himself not infrequently quotes various apocryphal works,
especially Jesus Sirach, once expressly introducing his quotation with a dicente
scriptura sancta (Comment. on Isaiah, iii, 12). Meanwhile the XVestern
Church, striving after unequivocal and definite forms, did not regard with
favour this somewhat uncertain intermediate position of the books allowed to
be read (libri ecclesiastici). Instead of now solving the problem by an
uncompromising acceptance of the Jewish practice, the attempt was rather
made to abolish altogether the distinction between canonical books and books
that might simply be read. In the Latin Bible MSS. prior to Jerome, just as
among the Greeks, non-canonical writings are found along with the canonical.
Only here the number of the non-canonical writings did not vary so much as
among the Greeks, while the MSS. regularly embraced the writings received by
most of the churches, i.e., the Wisdom of Solomon‚ Jesus Sirach (or Ecclesias-
ticus), Tobit, Judith‚ 1 and 2 Maccabees, and the additions to Daniel, Esther
and Jeremiah. The ecclesiastical usus was now regarded as decisive, and all
those writings were pronounced canonical without paying any regard to the
Jewish Canon and the opposing remarks of Jeronie.’⁷ The leading impetus in
this direction came from Augustine, and the church of North Africa in the
Councils of Hippo, ΑΛ). 393, and Carthage, A.D. 397. The great teacher
himself gives a list of “the whole canon of Scripture‚'' adding, “in all these
books those who sear God and are of a meek and pious disposition seek the
will of God.'' Now this list includes Tobit, Judith‚ 1 and 2 Maccabees, as well
as Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus. The lists drawn up by the Councils of Hippo
and Carthage are similar in character, though the order of books is
different. This whole tendency received a fixed form in the decision of the
Council of Trent, which pronounced the books named by Augustine to be
canonical, but excluded 3 and 4 Esdras as uncanonical. The authoritative

ESDRAS. The name Esdras, in the Welsh and English Bibles of the
Authorised Version, is now reserved for the two Apocryphal books attributed
to Ezra. These two, owing to the fact that Ezra and Nehemiah were regarded
as First and Second Ezra, were reckoned, in editions of the Vulgate, as Third
and Fourth ; in our Bibles, by the use of the names First and Second Esdras, a
mode of naming less correct historically than the other has been introduced.
