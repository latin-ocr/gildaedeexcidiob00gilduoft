After these things, they are more ready to seek ecclesiastical
positions than the kingdom of heaven ; and these, when received by
an illegal rite, they defend without even adorning them by legiti-
mate usages. Towards the precepts of the saintS, if indeed they
shave at any time heard these things, which ought to be very
frequently heard by them, they are listless and dull ; while for public
games and the scandalous tales of men of the world, they are
active and attentive ; as if the things which open the way of death
were the way of life. They are hoarse, by reason of fat, like bulls ;

even to hell, though with the remorse of conscience; grieving at
the loss of a single penny, glad also at the gain of one. In

was τ “ 1 am a Christian ;'' whereupon He who sat upon the throne said z “ Thou
liest: thou art a Ciceronian, nota Christian.'' After the severe flogging inflicted
upon him by the Judge, he vows that he will never again read “ secular books '²
(codices seculares). His antagonist Rufinus could well reproach him that the
vow was badly kept. There was an uneasy feeling in such men as Jemme,
Augustine, Paulinus of Nola, with respect to the reading of heathen writings;
but such anxiety of mind before long disappeared; then came likewise the
abandonment of Homer, Virgil and Cicero. Another kind of reading spread
widely, with a taste newly formed, which eagerly scanned the praecepta
sanctorum. Under this term we may include the works of the ecclesiastical
writers, but more especially such writings as those of John Cassian and the
popular Lz'ves of saints, a species of literature introduced by Jerome.

Eucher, about a hundred years before Gildas penned these words, wrote a
letter of advice to a relative (Epistola paraenetica aa' Valerianum cognatam), in
which he exhorts him to abandon the works of secular writers, and devote him-
self to the study of Christian doctrine, to the studies and writings os our men
(ad studia le nostrorum et scripta converte), and especially to approach as a
searcher “ad fontes ipsos sacri eloquii.'' Can. v of Statuta Ecclesiae Antiqua,
c. A.D. 450-500, commonly observed in Gaul, directs “That a bishop shall not
read heathen books (genlz'lz'mn libres), but those of heretics, as demanded by
the necessity of the times.⁷' The spirit of such admonitions spread more
and more, though several writers besides Boetius and Cassiodorus con-
tinued in a feeble, declining way, to show that the old taste was still alive.
The story told by John of Salesbury, that Gregory the Great caused the valuable
Palatine Library to be burnt, lest the study of Scripture might be prejudiced by
the perusal of its books, is at least a true picture of the sentiments entertained
by men of the monastery during the fifth and sixth centuries. Gildas may be
understood as presenting here the view held by a fervent monk, of the men
in Britain who still continued to read the ancient literature.
