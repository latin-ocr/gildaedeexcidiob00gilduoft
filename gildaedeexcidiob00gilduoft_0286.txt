the number of monks congregated in them, belong to the end of
Gildas’ time ; belong, as may be conjectured, to the revival begun
by him and his friends. Such a one was Bangor is y Coed, in
Flintshire‚ which, according to Beda's description, had no less than
2,100 monks within its walls: such were Clonard‚ Clonfert‚ Clon-
macnoise, and Bangor, in Ireland.1 The founder of Clonard was
Finnian, who is also regarded as the father of the new monastic
revival which led to the foundation of so vast a number of monas-
teries in Ireland. But he is also said to have come, as a boy of
thirteen yearS‚ to Kilmuine (Cil-mynyw) in wales, where he became
a disciple of “the three holy men, David, Cathmael‚ and Gildas.”
This is the Finnian whose Penitential is extant, which seems to
form a further link in his connection with Gildas.

Bennchor, or Bangor (in county Down), was founded by Com-
gall, who in his early training had come in contact with the same
WVelshmen and Welsh traditions as Finnian. When, therefore, we
rcmember that Columbanus was a monk of Bangor, as he with

twelvc companions left his native island for France‚pr0 Deo
peregrinantes, we are led to connect him also with that band of
Vv'elshmen. For the use of his monastery at Luxeuil he drew up
a Rule that was notably Irish in its strictness; but besides this
Regula, there goes under his name a Penitential‚ which, with

 

 

¹ It is not in any way improbable that the accounts found of these wonder-
fully numerous communities are echoes of the reports which circulated‚ through
such writings as those ofJerome and Cassian, of the teeming multitudes that
flocked to the monasteries of Egypt. Griitzmacher‚ in his book on Pachomz'us
und das ‹i'llesle Kloslerleben (1896), shows how like representations are
found even in the Coptic and other Lives, lately translated into French by
Amilineau. Tabennisi, the original cloister of PachomiuS. grew to number
2500 monks within its walls (s. 99>; Cassian mentions 3 monastery in the
Thebaid, in which there were “over 5000 brethren under one abbot'⁷ (De Coen.
lnstit„ iv, 1); Jerome, in like manner, speaks of a community numbering¹
5000 (Ep, 22, 33), and of single monasteries as containing from thirty to forty
houses, in each of which dwelt forty monks (Prologus aci Reg. S. Passa).

Since Egypt formed the ideal of monasticism for British and Irish monks,
it is not to be wondered at that a period of prosperity should be described by
them in terms borrowed from the marvellous stories of that land. Beda’s
statement respecting Bangor is only what report had brought to him (serlur),
‘· when the community was divided into seven portions, no portion contained
scu-cr than 300 mcn⁷' (H. E„ ii, 2). Clonard waS‚ the same way, said to have

, 3000 monks. Its famous founder is described as follows :—
Trium virorum millium
Sorte fit doctor humilis,
Verbi his fudit fluvium
Ut sons emanans rivulis.
