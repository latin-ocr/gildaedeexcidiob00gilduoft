THE PENITENTIAL OF GILDAs. DE POENITENTIA.

IT may be well here to remind the reader of a few points that
are treated of at greater length in the Introduction. The Church,
for purposes of discipline, had developed various modes of cor-
rection in the case of lapses into sin, as well as of reconciliation
by absolution. As we approach the sixth century, we find a long
development of very varying procedures along independent lines,
and ending in the very reverse of agreement throughout the
Churches of different countries In one point, however, there
seems to have been universal agreement, viz.‚ that acts of contrition
and confession, together with the reconciliation which followed,
were purely ecclesiastical. While, for the most part, such acts of
penance were, in the W'est, not public but private, they certainly
were subject to the judgment of the bishop ; he, or the presbyter
representing him, was always the ministrant. Yet in Britain and
Ireland there had grown up a different system; tlze disciplz'naty
mensures were conducted from [lae cloisler. Different sins began to
be catalogued after the* manner of penal enactmentS, with the
corresponding penance to be undergone before reconciliation.
In the opening words of the Penitential of columbanus, “there
must be a virensium paenz'lenliae,” calculated according to the magni-
tude of the sins committed. What this missionary did not quite
find in Gaul, according to the words of his biographer Jonas, viz„
poenitenliae medicamenta et morlzficaliom's amor, he brought to that
country from his Irish home. People from all parts soon flocked
to his monastery at Luxeuil to partake of the benefit of the
“medicine of penance” (Vita Col, 2). Books containing such
rules, by which sins and the appointed penances were thus
arranged in order, were called PEN1TENT1ALs(Libm‘poenitenfialas).
They seem to have had their origin in Britain and Ireland, but,
after the seventh century, they are found both in the English
Church, and in Churches far and wide over the Continent. Some
who read the present l'enitential, assigned to Gildas, for the first
time, may be surprised, if not shoclzed, at some of the rules con-
tained in it ; but let them reflect that what they read here might be
