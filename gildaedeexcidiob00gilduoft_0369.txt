prince called Werocus, commanding him to give his daughter in
marriage. When Werocus‚ Count of Vannes, heard this, he
straightway answered ‘the messenger‚ saying: How can J give
my dauglzter to be stain by your uzaster's accursed sword P Have
5 l not heard of tlte uzassacre lze llas made of [lae [adies wlzo
lzad been married to ln'm P I certainly will not do so: for my
daughter slzall not risk deatlc as loug as J can drive it away
from laer.
2 I The messengers, therefore, returned and reported to the afore-
10 mentioned malefactor the reply which Werocus had given thern.
But he desisted not from the course he had begun, and again and
again charged Werocus, saying: PVlzatever hostages or suretz'es
tliou desirest, I will give tllee: do tlzou but graut me my request.
Werocus answered him: Vaiu is tlzy suit,· to uo purpose dost
15 tlzou labour in tliy request. For· unless tlzou givest me St. Gildas
as surety, tllou wilt iu no way succeed in tlzy petitiou ,· for to
uo oue, except tlirouglz llis stands, will I deliver my daughter.
Now the king at once sent messengers to St. Gildas, desiring
him to corne with all speed, and receive, on the promise of his
20 protection, a daughter from her father’s hand, and give her to him
in legitimate wedlock as his wife. But the saint, in disapproval
of their words, said in answer to them: You know that your
master is a very cunning ulau, aud ruiued by a tyrannical savage-
uess: if J assent, aud if lie pledge me as a surety aud tlleu leill
25 tlte maiden, I slmll leave fallen into a grievous sin before tlle Lord,
aud slave separated lzer parents from me by tlle violent bereave-
ment of tlzeir child, aud caused them to sigla deeply witlc intolerable
grief. But, uevertlzeless, J will come with you, aud discuss tlze
wishes of botlz parties, even of tlte parents aud of lum wlco lias
30 directed you to me. Then he goes along with them, and finds the
princes themselves had assembled to discuss this business. And
while they were deliberating about this matter, the maiden's father
said to Gildas: Is tlzou wilt receive my daughter under tlzy chmge,
I will trust thee, l will deliver lter to tliee. But if tlzou rafuse
35 to take lzer, tlzis man sliall uever slave lzer. St. Gildas said to him :
Deliver lzer to me, aud J, protected by tlte power of God, slzall
restore lzer to tlzee safe. The aforesaid tyrant, therefore, received

 

century document to work upon, as the use of this name W'e1·ocus for the
Breton Count of Venetum shows ; but that the document did not extend further
than the beginning of c. 32, is made plain by the late and extraneous matter there
introduced, and the forms of the names mentioned 3 of these Guerecus is one.
