¹ Sanctormn onmium congregrationi& These words appear to have a
bearing upon the history of the Roman Symbol, or, as generally called, the
Apostles’ Creed, in Britain. The singularity found in an Irish form of the Creed
has been frequently commented upon : that form is as follows : “ I believe tlzat
there is a holy Catholic Church, a communion of saints, etc.’' <sanctam esse
ecclesiam catholicam).* But in the present expression we find ourselves
witnessing, probably, the very time of the introduction of the phrase ‘⁴ com-
munion of saints'' into the Church of Britain. Zahn says, that “the origin and
the original meaning of sanctorum communionem are still obscure ;'²† he proves,
however, what is also generally accepted, that the phrase, along with “ sztlzolz‘c
Chu1·ch,'' appears for the first time in Nicetas (c. A.D. 400), and afterwards in
a writer almost contemporary with Gildas, Caesarius of Arles (died 542). The
very expression used by Nicetas respecting the Catholic Church, in the sermon
or Eaplcznatz‘o Symboli, from which the Creed as known by him is extracted,
is that of Gildas heresssanctormn omnium congregatio. “ Communion of
saints‚’“ we gather, meant “the assembly, or congregation, of all saints,''
at the time when the phrase emerges into life in Britain. Hahn's Biblz'otlzek
der Symbole gives two forms of the Creed in which the words “all saints'' are
found (pp. 80, 115). Now the Commentary from which the first of these is
taken runs as follows : “they also confess one catholic slmrclz and communion o]
all saints, that is, the assembly (congregationem) of all believers in Christ'’
(Hahn‚ p. 355). Here, again, we have Gildas' congregatio in connection with
that enigmatical (to quote Harnack's word) expression “communion of saints‚”
which spread everywhere, and so found a fixed place in the T extus Receptus
of the Creed. Gildas appears to me, by the tenor of this last clause, to have
been acquainted with Augustinian phraseology, and, by this particular expres-
sion, acquainted also with the Apostles' Creed before it acquired its final form
in his own church.
