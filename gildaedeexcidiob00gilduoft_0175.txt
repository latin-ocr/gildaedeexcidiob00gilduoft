world, of which, if it be possible, sometime before the day of my
death, I desire and thirst to be a partaker. While my sides are
now made invincible by a rampart of two shields of saints, with
my back steadfast against the walls of truth‚ while my head is
most surely covered by the Lord’s help for a helmet, let the stones
of my censures fiy in a thick flight of truthful words.

1. Clzarges against wz'cked and reprobate priests, cc. 66-68.

Priests Britain has, but foolish ones; a great number of
ministers, but shameless3 clergy, but crafty plunderers; pastors,

10 so to say, but wolves ready for the slaughter of souls, certainly not

providing what is of benefit for the people, but secking the filling
of their own belly. They have church edifices, but enter them
for the sake of filthy lucre ; they teach the people, but by furnish-
ing the worst examples, teach vice and evil morals; they seldom

15 sacrifice, and never stand among the altars with pure beart ; they

 

that of c. 27, where kings and judges are censured : Reges habet Britannia sed
tyrannos ; iudices habet sed impios.

² Sacerdotes. This term, as well as ministri, clerici, pastores, may perhaps
include presbyters as well as bishops but the allusion to “the chair of Peter ''
evidently proves that the writer has the latter mainly in view,

3 Ecclesiae domus. The term ἐκκλησίας οἶκος, or οἶκοι ἐκκλησίας-,15 found at least
three times in Eusebius in the sense of “church building‚'’ or simply “ church,’⁷
z'.e.,the house or structure used by the Church forits assemblies. Paulos Samosata
refuses to leave the “ church house ;” but the Emperor Aurelian “decided the
matter most equitably, ordering the building (οἶκον) to be given to those to

whom the bishops of Italy and the city of Rome should adjudge it” (H. E,
vii, 30, 19. See also viii, 13, 13, of Constantius, who did not pull down “the

Church buildingS'': μήτε τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν τοὺς οἴκους καθελών. AISO ix, 9, 24).
Bingham <Book viii, 1, 3) understands domus ecclesiae in Can. Ι of the Second
Council of Toledo, A.D. 527 or 531, as signifying “ the bishop's house‚⁷' and
Hefele agrees with him <Concilgesclz.‚ ii, 719). Here, however, as the next words
imply, it can only have the meaning it has in the official language quoted or
alluded to in the pages of Eusebius. It may well contain a reminiscence of
the fact that Christian assemblies were, for two centuries or more, accustomed
to meet in private houses; or that the original architectural form of Christian
churches, in consequence of such a custom‚ was taken from the Roman private
house.

4 Raro sacrificantes. This use of the verb sacrzficare—to sacrifice—as well
as (fferre, along with the nouns sacerdos and altaria, affords proof how, in the
British Church of the sixth century, that idea of the Eucharist as the highest act
of worship, sacrificial worship, which found form and expression in other lands,
at that time and subsequently, was the prevalent one. These terms are not
used by Gildas in any figurative or metaphorical sense.
