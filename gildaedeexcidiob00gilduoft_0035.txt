that time the religion of Christ was propagated without any
hindrance, because the emperor, contrary to the will of the
senate, threatened with death informers against the soldiers of
that same religion.

9 Though these precepts had a lukewarm reception from the
inhabitants, nevertheless they continued unimpaired with some,
with others less so, until the nine years' persecution of the tyrant
Diocletian. In this persecution churches were ruined throughout
the whole world, all copies of the Holy Scriptures that could be

10 found were burnt in the open streetS, and the chosen priests of the
Lord's flock butchered with the innocent sheep, so that if it could
be brought to pass, not even a trace of the Christian religion would
be visible in some of the provinces. What ssights there were then,
what slaughter, what punishments by different modes of death,

15 what ruins of apostates, what glorious crowns of martyrs, what
mad fury on the part of persecutors, and, on the contrary, what

 

“by explosion'⁷ have no evidence whatever in their favour. “ L'ecole historique
n'admet point chez nous un Christianisme fait, comme on l'a dit, par explosion''

(Preface, xli, [ηπ. Clzre‘liemzes de la Gaule). A solid historic truth lies in that
curt lepide of Gildas.

3 lVovennem, the nine years’ persecution. 'she meaning to be attached to this
expression may be gained from c. 12, “when ten years had not yet been coni-
pleted.⁷⁷ Eusebius speaks of the persecution as having lasted len years (ὁ δεκαέτης
χρόνος, H. E, viii, 15), yet both numbers admit of ready explanation. The first
Edict of Diocletian, of which Gildas gives the first and second provisions, was
issued in February 303, and the Edict of Milan, terminating state persecution
of Christianity, appeared towards the end of 312. The period was in this way
a good deal more than nine years, though not quite ten. Gildas seems to be
simply copying or enumerating, in order, the provisions of Diocletian²s Edicts as
stated in Rufinus’ version of the Ecclesiaslz'cal Hislmy of Eusebius. By the
first provision of Edict 1, the churches were to be leyelled to the ground; by
the second, the Scriptures were to be burnt3 another provision, involving
degradation, finds no mention in this narrative of Gildas. Edict 11, published
not long after, commanded all church officers to be imprisoned without even
the option of recantation. Edict ΙΙΙ (or so-called Edict) again soon followed,
leading to the application of torture, which too often resulted in death, though
death hitherto had not been enjoined as a punishment. With Edict IV, in 304,
the persecution reached its fiercest point by reproducing the former measures
of Decius: commanding all men to offer sacrifice and libations to heathen
deities, it brought in its train the atrocities described by Eusebius, and
chronicled in so many Acta stlarlyrum. An African writer of the fourth
century describes the persecution in words that remind us of Gildas here : “ It
made some martyrs, others confessors3 some it demeaned in a calamitous
death 3 it spared only those who succeeded in hiding themselves’' (Optatus,
De Schism. Donat„ i, 13).
