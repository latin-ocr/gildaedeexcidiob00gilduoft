2 34 De Excidio Britanniae.

presbyters only, but two other ordines (ii and iii) printed by Martene in the
second volume of his De Antz‘qttis Ecclesiae Ritibus, prescribe it also sor
deacons. It is well known how rites differed in different countries even in the
sixth and seventh centuries 3 Augustine, the English missionary, was perturbed
in mind at the variations of usages and ritual 116 had observed during his journey
to Britain through Gaul, until reassured by his great master. “ Since there is
one faith‚'’ he asks, “ how can there be different usages in the churches ? How
is one use of masses observed in the Holy Roman Church and another in
Gau1?‘’ (Beda, H. E., i, 27). Of such ecclesiarum diversae consuetudines, as
observed by Augustine, might have been this very unction of hands ; because,
as has been observed, two ordines at least prescribe it for the three orders,
of which one, Martene⁷s ii, is the English Pontifical of Egbert ; Pope Nicolas I
is quoted by Martene (p. 315) as denying that it was evera Roman rite. We
gather from the words of Gildas that, in Britain, the rite formed part of the
ordination of bishops, and to our author, with his strong scriptural—one might
say, strong Old Testament—bent of mind, it was probably tlte significant
act of the whole service. His mind would revert back to the “ oil of holy oint-
ment,” as he saw bishop and presbyter anointed to a holier priesthood.

Another feature of the ordination service in Britain, preserved in these
pages of Gildas, is an account of the Scriptural readings or lessons selected for
that day (lectiones exemptae ut recitentur). It was these Iessons that gave its
seal to the act of consecration itself: such would seem to be the meaning of the
words ut adstipulentur benedictioni qua initiantur mames sacerdotum ; and it
certainly does appear strange that Gildas makes no further reference to the
consecratory prayer itself which constituted the benedictio proper. Itis diffi-
cult to determine how the readings were arranged: there were at least two
lessons, which were, probably, distributed as follows ε

First Lesson, I Peter i, ii, and Acts i, 15-26.
Second Lesson‚ I Timothy iii, and Matthew xxi, 13-19.

A third particular of the Eritish service is made known to us here : during
the service those to be ordained stood by the altar (eodem die altari astitistis),
no doubt sor the celebration of the missa connected with each ordination.

We have endeavoured to give, in the above account, all that can be gleaned
from Gildas. Meagre as it is, there is no small interest attaching· to it, inas-
much as what is found in this part of the QUERULUS LIBER is, probably, the
earliest description in Latin of an ordination service, unless an exception be
made of the simple beginnings witnessed in the Statum Ecclesiae Antiqua,
which, as Maassen concludes in his Gescll. der Quellen zmd der Lis. des canon.
li‘ecltts, i, 393, may have been compiled during the first half os the fifth century,
that is, about a hundred years before this work was written. The canonical
regulations of that collection seem to have been the norm of Church discipline
and observance in the west during the sixth century. (tlsigtu', Opp. S. Leonis,
Tom. iii, 679 ff) While this fact is certain in the case of Gaul and Spain,
may it not be extremely probable for Britain also?

Certain Gallic forms have already been mentioned, such as, 161 us repeat,

very special value sor us ; otherwise it is his incidental references to the
