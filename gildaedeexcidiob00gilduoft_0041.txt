clothes of the brother mentioned. Being in this way well pleasing
to God, during the time between his holy confession and cruel
death, in the presence of the impious men, who carried the Roman
standard with hateful haughtiness, he was wonderfully adorned with
5 miraculous signs, so that by fervent prayer he opened an unknown
way through the bed of the noble river Thames, similar to that
dry little-trodden way of the israelites, when the arl< of the
covenant stood long on the gravel in the middle of Jordan ; sossz. iii. 17.
accompanied by a thousand men, he wallced through with dry
10 foot, the rushing waters on either side hanging lil<e abrupt pre-
cipiceS, and converted first his executioner, as he saw such WOlidCrS,
from a wolf into a lamb, and caused him together with himself to
thirst more deeply for the triumphant palm of martyrdom, and more
bravely to seize it. Others, however, were so tortured with
15 diverse torments, and mangled with unheard of tearing of limbs,
that without delay they raised trophies of their glorious martyrdom,
as ifat the beautiful gates of Jerusalem. Those who survived hid
themselves in woods, deserts, and secret caveS, expecting from God,
the righteous ruler of all, to their persecutorS, sometime, stern
20judgment‚ to themselves protection oflife.

12 Thus when ten years of the violence referred to had scarcely
passed, and when the abominable edicts were disappearing through
the death of their authorS, all the soldiers of Christ, with gladsome
eyes, as if after a wintry and long night, take in the calm and the

25 serene light of the celestial region. They repair the churches‚

com-ilia martyrum. Jerome, Ep. 60, 12, speaks of basilicas ecclesiae et
marlyrum conciliabula ‚· but in Britain, as we have seen in a previous note, the
name that prex-ailed was marlyrz'mu, still common in welsh. Yet one place,
apparently, has preserved basilica in Welsh, This is Hassalec (Bassaleg) in
Glamorgan : see Index to Book osLlandas, p. 273, Bencdistus presbiter Bassalcrj
pp. 319, 323, 333, 344, ecclesia de Bzzsselec. Dr. Kuno Meyer has kindly sup>
plied me with several other instances where baslec stands sor basilica. “It occurs
twice in the Calendar of Oengus, November loth and September 15th. In the
Lebor Brecc, in the passion of Partholon (lla, Bartholomew): ‘they made
a great baslccsor him and placed his body into it' (p. 177a). In the Ammls,
edited by O'Grady, in Silvagadelim, p. 326, ΑΒ. 643, is an obscure quatrain:

which means, after his burial. Bm'sleac is the name of a par-ish church in co.
Roscommon, and Baz'sliocdn (dimin.) is the name of a townland in the parish of
