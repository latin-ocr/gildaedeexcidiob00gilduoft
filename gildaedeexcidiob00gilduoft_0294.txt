long persistence in sins, so that the years and days named in the preceding
rules ought not to be regarded as fixed inalterably. A similar modification
of what precedes will be found in the ninth canon of the Synod of the Grove
of Victory below (p. 288), though there by way of diminution.

1 In the rules which follow no grave sins are mentioned, in some none at
all, so that we seem justified in making a division here. The first part, under
A„ prescribes for crimina capitalia, to use a term found in the Penitential of
Columbanus, which, in the same manner, seems to divide itself into two parts

‘2 In morte est. This wholesome rule appears in several books3 in the
Penitential of Cummean, for instance, it reads : “ &Vhosoever keeps anger in his
heart towards another, must hejudged a homicide '⁷ (Poen. Cusum„ ix, 9).

3 Ad consummactionem. Mark the striking resemblance of Poen. xxxv
eapp.,31 ; W‘ass„ p. 524: “ Si quis non occurrit ad secmzdipsalmi consuma-
tionem, canat viii, in ordine Psalm, &c.,’' as in this book of Gildas. Our Rule
(19) is almost word for word identical with that found, as indicated, in the
Frankish Penilential ο] xant· Chapter-Q which is a work founded upon the
Penitentials of Cummean, Columbanus, and The0d0re; the many Celtic

materials used by its author lead to the conclusion that the work must have
been drawn up in one of the Irish monasteries of the Continent, and we may

conclude that the author copied the present Rule, either from this collection of
Gildas or from some other containing it. Therefore, it does not seem rash to
supply the words secundipsalmi from the Frankish Poenitential. The Regula
of Columbanus makes it clear, that the Cursus l'salmorum‚ that is, the singing
or recitation of Psalms in a specified order, formed an important part of the
service at every common gathering*Synaxis-- of the brethren: the present
rule, therefore, specifies the discipline incurred by sailing to appear when
the second Psalm was ended. lf the rule applies to the Allaae‘ltl‘l'mzl gatliering,
the number of Psalms sung would vary at different times of the year, according
to the length of night : isto other day gatherings, three Psalms only were sung.
