we have, moreover, Liber Ecclesiasticus Salomonis as the title 01 a Fragment
published by Paul de Lagarde. Here is the tradition in which we find Gildas
and the ssritish Church 3 to thern Solomon is the author of five books, the two
named above, along with the three found in our Bibles. Such an opinion would
bave been impossible at tlze lale dale assigned by some writers lo lbe De E xczdz‘o.

If anybody were inclined to belittle Gildas and his countrymen, because
about 540 they still held to these traditionary‚ but impossible, views respecting
the authorship of these books, it would be well to remember that even the
great Teacher 01 1116 West‚ Augustine, had very hazy ideas respecting the same
question when writing the earlier books of the De Doctrina Christiana: this
was in 397. “For two books‚³' he writes, “one called XVisdom and the other
Ecclesiasticus, are ascribed to Solonion from a certain resemblance 01 style, but
the most likely opinion is that they were written by Jesus the son of Sirach⁷'
(ii, 8). Afterwards, in the Retraclationes, ii, 4, written about 427, 116 corrects this
statement: non ita constare, sicut a me dictum est, postea didici el omnino
probabilius comperi, που esse bunc eius libri auclorcm.

Solonion, we observe, is here called “ prophet ;'' this may be explained by
the words of Augustine: ‘⁴ Next the Prophets, in which there is one book of
David, the Psalms, and three of Solomon—Proverbs, Song of Songs and
Ecclesiastes . . . . The remainder are the books of those strictly called
Prophets.'’ Isidore of Seville, also, who died A.D. 636, and is thus later than
Gildas, in his De Ordine Librorum S. Scm'plurae, writes : ‘⁸' Occurrunt dehinc
Prophetae, in (1011305 651 Psalmorum liber unus, et Salomonis libri tres,
proverbiorum scilicet, Ecclesiastes et Cantica Canticorum.'' There was thus a
sense in which, along with “the xvi Books 01 1116 Prophet5,” the books passing
under the names of David and Solonion were regarded 35 prophetical. Gildas,
1ν6 566, 15 131 110111 standing alone in this application of the name.

of the law, has threatened, treating in this manner: Tbus says4 Esdr· xv-

no more. The Most High gave understanding unto the five men, and they
wrote by course the things that were told them, in characters which they knew
not, and they sat sorty days : now they wrote in the day-time, and at night they
ate bread. As 101 1116, Ι spake in the day, and by night I held not my tongue.
So in forty days were written four-score and fourteen books. And it came to
pass, when the forty days were fulfilled, that the Most High spake unto me,
saying, The first which thou hast written publish openly, and let the worthy and
unworthy read it : but keep the seventy last, that thou mayest deliver them to
such 35 be wise among thy people : for in them 15 1116 spring 01 understanding,
the sountain 01 wisdom, and the stream 01 knowledge. And I did so.'' (The
question 01 reading in this last passage can scarcely concern 05.) The
twenty-four books (94—70) which Esdras is to publish openly cannot but be the
twenty-four books of the Old Testament canon, while the remaining seventy
would be mystical or Apocryphal books. From this story came, with slight
alteration and refinement, the idea that Ezra performed the task of collector or
editor for the books 01 1116 Old Testament. In 1161136115, v. S (c. ΑΛ). 180), 1116
story is told thus : “ And this was nothing wonderful for God to do, who, in the
captivity 01 1116 people under Nebuchadnezzar, when the Scriptures had been
