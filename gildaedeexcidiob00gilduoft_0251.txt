6. When the suggestions furnished by Gildas are viewed in the light of the
preceding outline of the manner in which ordinations were conducted in
VVestern Europe about the sixth century, we may venture to draw the following·
conclusions as to the British Church: (1) The three offices of the Church's
ministry were elective, at least in theory. (2) The formulae employed in
ordination, amid a variety that implies a primarily independent life, had taken
a somewhat fixed form. (3) The leading symbolical act 1n ordination, at that
time, was the unction of hands, though such a conception would not exclude
other acts that have a symbolical character, and the words, ‘⁸ on the same day
ye stood by the altar⁷’, certainly imply the celebration of the missae as directed
in such Ordinals as those mentioned above. (4) The same form, though
accompanied by definitely different acts, was used in the ordination of both
presbyter and bishop.

For Gildas, there seems no room to doubt, the prominent, almost the only,
idea of the ministry is that of a ministry of teaching, guidance, and govern-
ment ; at the same time, his constant use of alsam would suggest that Britain,
just as Gaul, had entered upon the Mediaeval view of the priest's function, as
witnessed in the words: Ut . . . . corpus et sanguinem Filii tui illllnczculalcz
benedictione lmnsformel, in the M z'ssczle F mulserunt.

But why will Ι use at considerable length the testimonies of
opinion, though expressed by various persons and scattered here
and there? Why will I be tossed on the waves in the despicable
craft of my own intellect. Ι have thought it necessary to recur
finally to those lessons which have been extracted from almost
every befitting text of the Holy Scriptures, not only to be repeated
for this present object, but also to be a confirmation of the rite by
which the hands of priests or ministers are consecrated, and to

lt seems, not infrequently, to be used for the ordines minores as a class.
Thus, ministri ecclesiae in Cypr., Ep. 34, 4; also Sulp. Sev., Vita S. Μανί,
9, 5 : cum sorluilo lector defuisset turbatis mim‘slris, etc. Gildas himself calls
Stephen proto-minister, c. 73.

On the other hand, the context seems to favour the view that vel has its
usual meaning, and therefore ministri in its inclusive meaning is an alternative
term for sacerdotes. It is so employed above: quam plurimos ministros, c. 66.
