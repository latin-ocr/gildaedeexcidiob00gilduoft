¹ The Scoti came from the North VVest <cz circione). This would fit well
with the explanation that at this time they had made no fixed settlements in the
land subsequently ‹zalled after them Scotland. Until the tenth century, Scoli or
Scatti, and Scolia or Scotlia, in Latin writers, mean respectively Irishmen and
Ireland ; in c. 21 Gildas calls them grassatores Hiberni. After the Dalriad
migration of Irish settlers in Cantyre and the island of Islay, about A.D. 502,
there were Scoti “qui Britanniam inhabitant,” as Beda could write in Book 1
of his Hz'sl07y; but at the time to which Gildas refers any occupatiori that
might hai-e taken place was merely migratory. The first mention of Picts, by
the summa-ysicus of AD. 292, refers also to le'berm'. We find an irruption of
Seots trud Picts (Scottorum Pictorumque gentium serarum excursus) first
mentioned by Ammianus Marcellinus, Book xx, i, 1, while writing of Julian’s
:irtivity in (⁷3ai11(A.1›.360). Four years later, he relates, the Picti, Saxones,
Scotti, and Atacotti, were harassing the country (xxvi, 4, 5). It is not strange,
therefore, when contingents from over the seas had been, thus so long, abetting
the northern barbarianS, that Gildas should speak of lransmclrt'mze gentes,
though the l'icts (lid not come under that desig-marion. Beda, in copying
(lililas, gives an explanation of the term z “ we say lrausmarz‘mze gentes, not
because they were outside Britain, but because they were remote with respect
to the liritons, and two bays intervened'' (ll. E„ i, 12). Plummer pronounces
this to be a very forced gloss (vol. ii, ]). 23) ; cf. also the words of c. 17, which
tell us that they were driven over seas by the Roman troops: trans maria
Jisgtwcrmzf. The adverb, primum, has been understood as implying that this
rusb of §mis and I‘icts, about AJ). 383, was their first inroad into Britain.
