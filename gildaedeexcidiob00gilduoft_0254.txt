THE LATIN TEXT OF THE ORDINAL.

The extracts made by Gildas from the lessons of his Ordinal bear, as has
been observed, several marks of adapta-tion to suit the special purpose of public
reading, just as other Lectionaries or Sei-vice-books of Churches. For in-
stance, we have the Imperatives succincti estote, sancti estote, castificate, instead
of succincti, sancti silis, castificantes .· but the interpolation of carissimi in
1 Pet. i, 22, and fratres in 1 Tim. iii, 1, is a still clearer mark of accommoda-
tion for ecclesiastical use. It will be found that what was said on p. 92 is too
sweeping. The Service-book itself may very likely have been drawn up from
separate volumes containing separate parts of Scripture, and, rnoreover, of very
different type of text. It seems safe to conclude that the Lessons from 1 Peter
and Acts in the volume were copied from a codex of which the Latin text was
older than the Vulgate3 on the other hand, the Lessons from 1 Timothy and
Matthew xvi are in the Vulgate version, with various readings, that may nearly
all be found in the MSS. of that version, together with certain of the old Latin
codices.

Gildas, in this part, is somewhat more frequent and copious than elsewhere
in interjectory vehement remarks. Ι have, therefore, printed the quotations
made from the Lectiones consecutively. lt will be quite evident that only
sections of those regarded by him as most pertinent have been quoted, and
that there are frequent intentional omissions. For the Gospel I have used the
new Oxford edition.
