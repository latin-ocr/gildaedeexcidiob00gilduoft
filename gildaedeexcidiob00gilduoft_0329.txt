VITA Ι.

“VITA GILDAE,’' WRITTEN ΒΥ A MONK OF THE MONASTERY
OF Ruvs IN BRITTANV.

THE Vita which is printed here was first published in 1605 by
John a Bosco, in his Bibliotheca Floriacensz‘s, from a MS. which he
describes as imperfect (ex vetustissimis Floriacensibus membranis
in quibus tamen quaedam desunt). The Benedictine monastery of
Fleury—saint Benoit-sur-Loire‚ or in Latin Floriacmn—was,
during the loth and 11th century, in close and frequent relation
with Brittany3 in 958, Edren, or Ebren, bishop of the Breton
city of Nantes‚ enters the monastery of Fleury ; thirty years later,
Alam, Count of Nantes, sends his son Guerech to be educated at
the same monastery. Mabbo, a bishop of Nantes, about the
beginning of the Ilth century, abandoning his episcopal see,
betakes himself to Fleury; and a Breton monk, by name Felix,
came from that monastery to reform certain Breton monasteries‚
and to die at Saint Gildas de Ruys in 1038.1 It appears natural
that MSS. from Brittany should come to Fleury, and one which
found its way from thence to Berne, even bears the dedication
Hunc codicem Μ abba eps. dedit Sco. Benedicta (cod. Berncnsis 277).
There are, in this connection, good grounds to regard Fleury as the
home to which the Brcton “ Lix·es’' of the VVelshmen, Samson of
Dol, Paul Aurelian of Leon, Maclovius (St. Malo), and the Life of
Gz'ldas, printed in this volume, came before their final dispersion.2
The first of these was written probably as early as the middle of
the 7th century,3 the second, as the author informs us, in the year

³ The Vita samsonis cannot be anterior to the seventh century, because the

writer is familiar with the Hcmilies of Gregmy 1, as may be seen by a com—
parison of c. 6 with Hem. ll] ἰν] Ewng.; neither can it be later than Nominoe,

hat is, than 824.
