of their victorious troops, and have no desire for the goods of
others? Who, like Abraham, at the command of God, has volun-
tarily offered his own son to be slain on the altar, so that he should
fulfil a command similar to that given by Christ when he says that Matt- v, 29.

quite in the way that the “ Penitential'' of Vinnianus also refers to it. Further,
there is printed in our present volume a “ Penitential’⁷ of Gildas ; we know also
of the Penitential canons of a British Synod (perhaps the Senedd Vrevi, men-
tioned in the Buclzedd Dewi, p. 112, Elucz'darz'um, ed. by John Morris Jones) ;
of another Synod at Lucus Victoriae, and similar canons from “The Book os
David.’' The four fragments just named have been published by &Vasserschleben
in his Bussordungen der Ahendla'nd. Kirclze3 the Fe‘camp MS„ from which
they are taken, is sully described by Maassen (Gesclziclzte der qzcellerz u. der
Lil. des canonisclzen Rechts, s. 784). When the ‘⁶ De Paenitentia⁷⁷ of Gildas, the
seven canons of Sinodzcs Aquilonalis Britanniae, the nine of Sinodus Luci
Victoriae, and the sixteen given as Excerpta quaedam de Libro Davz'das, are
compared with the Penitentials of Vinnianus and Columbanus, they reveal to
us a new phase of Church discipline, of which the cloister, not the bishop's
church, is the centre. The position is novel, so also is the penance ; both are
Celtic.

The book of such a discipline would contain an enumeration of sins,
together with the penance imposed in the case of each, for the healing of the
soul. The usage itself of resorting to an abbot for “the medicine of penance,''
is, some two or three times, mentioned as taking place at Iona under Columba
(Adamnan‚ Vita ἀφῖκτό, i, 223 ii, 39), but the defect deprecated by Gildas
in the present passage, shows that anything like a general use of Penitentials
had not, when he wrote, established itself in Britain.

On the question of Penitentials see Seebass, Das Foenitetztiale Columbam',
Zeitschrifl fiir K z'rcheugesclc., xiv, 430 ; Realencyklopa'dze of Herzog, 31⁴d edition,
iii, 581 ; and for a very different opinion, Schmitz, Die Bussbucher und die
Bussdisczplin der K irclte.
