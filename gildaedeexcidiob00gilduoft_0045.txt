T lze Rm'n of Britain. 3 3

fortified by hazardous deeds of so dangerous a character, it was
not long ere he lost his accursed head at Aquileia: he who
had in a way cut off the crowned heads of the empire of the whole
world.

14 After this, Britain is robbed of all her armed soldiery, of her
military supplies, of her rulers, cruel though they were, and of her
vigorous youth who followed the footsteps of the above-mentioned
tyrant and never returned. Completely ignorant of the practice of
war, she is, for the first time, open to be trampled upon by two

10 foreign tribes of extreme cruelty, the Scots from the north-west,
the Picts from the north; and for many years continues stunned

15 and groaning. Owing to the inroads of these tribes and the con-
sequent dreadful prostration, Britain sends an embassy with letters
to Rome, entreating in tearful appeals an armed force to avenge

15 her, and vowing submission on her part to the Roman power,
uninterrupted and with all strength of heart, if the enemy were
driven away. A legion is forthwith prepared,with no remembrance
of past evil, and fully equipped. Having crossed over the sea in
ships to Britain, it came into close engagement with the oppressive

20 enemies; it killed a great number of them and drove all over the
borders‚ and freed the humiliated inhabitants from so fierce a
violence and threatening bondage. The inhabitants were com-
manded to build a wall across the island, between the two seaS‚ so

Gratian was unwillingly acknowledged Emperor by Theodosius and Valentinian.
NVhen Valentinian fied, the usurper approaclied Italy, being at Aquileia in
September or October 387, and at Rome early in 388. His death took place in
the summer of that year, so that it was impossible for any Roman armament to
help the Britons in repelling the barbarian marauders before 388 or 389. The
“many years'⁷ (mullos sllsfies granisque annos) of suffering, to which Gildas
alludes in the previous section, are explained by this fact. We know also that
the thh legion, stationed at Chester, was withdrawn by Stilicho in 402 or 4o3;
and from Claudian's De Bello Getico (vv. 416-418), that it had previously served
against the Picts and Scots. This legion may, therefore, have been part of the
force employed in the attack now mentioned.
