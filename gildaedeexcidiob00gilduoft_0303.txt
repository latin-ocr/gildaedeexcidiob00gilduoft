Τ lze Lorz'ca of Gildas. 291

editors call B, after a fresh collation of the same, as well as of the Book of
Cerne and the Book of Numamz’nster.

The present edition is a transcript from No. 7.

We find the name Lorica applied to several hymnS, or prayers
in verse, for protection in dangers of any kind—“Schutzgebete‚'' as
they are called by Bellesheim. But it seems natural to infer that
the name at first arose from this very Hymn that is ascribed to
Gildas. In the MS. from which Mone printed it, in his lsymni
Latini Medic· Aevi, and Zimmer in Nemlz‘us Vindicate& (1893),
as well as Daniel's MS. for his edition of it, in Thesaurus flymn.
iv, 364, there appears the short suggestive title, “ Hymn of the
Lorica” (Hymmtm Lorz‘caej.1 The reason is evident from vv. 57,
61; God‚ in the former, is asked to be, for him that prays, a
breast-plate, or cuirass, or corslet‚ and the words “ with the strong
lorica‚” of the latter verse, are understood in every petition of
the fifteen succeeding couplets beginning with “ cover '' (lege).
At that time, therefore, the Hymn itself is not calleda Lorzca.
The preface to the Lorica of St. Patrick, as it is called on
p. 381 of the Tripartz'te sze,2 is thus translated: “ Patrick made
this Hymn. In the time of Loegaire MacNeill it was made.

 

¹ The MS, of which Daniel used a transcript seems to resemble that of
Mone very closely all through. Daniel prints Hymmcm Lyrice‚· but the true
reading is given by Zimmer, Hymmmz Larisae, where, as often, ατο.

2 See also the Preface and the Lorica in English, in [risle Liber Hymnorum‚
ii, p. 49 (notes on p. 209); its first lines bear some resemblance to that of

Gildas :
“ I arise to-day :

vast night, invocation of the Trinity,—
belief in a Threeness

confession of Oneness

meeting in the Creator (?>.⁷’

Lines 11-20 may also be compared with the invocatory lines of Gildas :-—

“ Ι arise to—day :
might of grades of Cherubim
in obedience of Angels
[in ministration of archangels]
in hope of resurrection for the sake of reward
in prayers of Patriarchs
in prophecies of Prophets
in preachings of Apostles,
in faiths of confessors
in innocence of holy virgins
in deeds of righteous men.’²
