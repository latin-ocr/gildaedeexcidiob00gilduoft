Doubtful Fragments. 269

VIII. GILDAS.—To the wise man truth shines from whatsoever
mouth it has issued forth.

IX. GILDAS.—Miriam is condemned with leprosy, because she Num. xii.

DOUBTFUL FRAGMENTS.

X. GILDAS SAYS: The Britons are contrary to the whole
world [enemies to Roman usages not only in the maSS, but also in

10 tonsure, because, along with the Jews, they serve the shadows of
things to come rather than the truth].

 

bishops,'' Aldhelm is bold to say to them, “are not in accord with the Catholic
faith.⁷’ The Roman system represented a newer, better development of church
life : Eritish (and Irish) opposition‚ on the other hand, was in reality mainly a
reluctance to break with the past, by a people tenacious in their adherence to
everything old: however, after a long and bitter strife, the Irish, the North
British, the Picts, and eventually the Welsh, consented to the changes required
of them. Yet the conformity was but partial, as we learn from the fragments
remaining to us, and particularly as to Ireland, from the Life of St. Malea-hias,
who became Bishop of Armagh in the year 1126. If we note the chief points
in which the Eritish were regarded in church life as “hostile to Roman customs
(moribus Romanis),'’ they seem to be the four following :—

1. The British liturgy: it was in no way strange that in Britain there should
be a liturgy, or missa, different from the Roman 3 several extant Gallie forms
show that great diversity prevailed in Gaul and Germany until the time of
Charles the Great. There is a Frankish capitulary ofthe year 742, which even
ordains that every priest was to draw up for his own use a book of the altar-
service, subject to the approval of the bishop. A similar diversity must have
prevailed in Ireland and Britain during the sixth century3 in the anonymous
Calalogue os lrislc Sainls, the Second Order (c. A.D. 599-665) is described as
having diversae missae, and also as having “received a missa from the Britons
David bishop, Gillas (Gildas) and Docus'' <Haddan and Stubbs, Councz'ls, ii,
pp. 492-493). Unfortunately, no documents of this peculiarly Celtic liturgy
have survived; the Stowe missal, of which Todd and MacCarthy place the
authorship about seventy years after the death of Gildas, and W'arren brings
down to the ninth century, shows a predominant Roman character, though with
numerous traces of old Celtic features; these again plainly indicate a close
relationship with Gallican liturgica] forms.

2. Tonsure ; this second point of difference played an important part in the
schism between the British and English, that is the Roman, Churches. The
British tonsure, here described as being frontal from ear to ear7 and not coronal
like the Roman, is also, in similar words, twice described in the Catalogne os
Irislz Salium, ab aure usque ad aurem. A full account of the beliefs held
respecting these tim, the Roman derived from St. Peter, and a symbol of the
