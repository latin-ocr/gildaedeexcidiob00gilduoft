T he Ruin of Britain. 203

83 Little do you think or do what the holy prophet Joel also has
said in admonition of lazy priests, and lamenting the people’s loss
through their iniquities : Awake ye tliat are drunk tlirouglt your wine, Joel i, 5-12.
and weep and lanient all wllo driuk wine uuto druuleenuess, because

5 joy and gladness is taken away frouz your moutlz. M ourn, ye priests,
tlzat serve tlte altar, because tltefields leave become wretched. Let tlte
eartlz mourn because tlte corn is become wretched and tlte vine dried
up, tlte oil is dz'mz‘m‘shed, tlle husbandmen leave become languisti.
spsourn, ye estates, for tlte wlleat and barley, because tbe vine lzarvest

10 is perislied from tlte field, tlze vine is dried up, tbe g-trees leave
become fewer: tlte pmuegranates, palum, apple-tree, aud all trees os
tlze field are witbercd, because tlte sons of meu lzave tlirown joy into
confusion. All these words must be understood by you in 3
spiritual sense, lest your souls be withered by so destructive 3

15 famine for the Word of God.

Again ε W⁷eep ye priests tlzat serve tlte Lord, saying‚ Spare, Lord, laelii, 17.
tliy people ,· give not tliine inlieritance to reproaclt‚ aud let not tlte
Gentiles rule over tliem, lest tlte Gentiles say, W bere is tlleir God ,Ρ
Yet ye in no wise 11631 111656 things, but permit 311 things by

20 which the indignation of the divine anger is kindled.

84 Give express heed to what the holy prophet Hosea also says to
priests of your small stature: Hear tlzz‘s, ye priests aud bearken, Hosea v, 1.
tliou liouse of Israel, and tlzou, liouse of tlte king, fasten tlieuz in your
ears, since judgmeut is toward you, because ye liave been made a

25 snare unto watcltfuluess, aud lilee a net spread upon Τ abor, wliiclt

tliey wlzo bave set tlte liunt lzave fixed.
85 ΤΟ you also there is signified an 311611311011 of this kind from

the Lord by the prophet Amos, when he says: I bave lzated and Amos v, 21-23.
tlirust away your feast-days, and J will not accept a sweet savour in
30 your solemn assemblies, because, tliougli ye offer your burut offeriugs

 

3 Altario. The Latin of the Biblical and Ecclesiastical language, by
metaplasm‚ employs the second declension in this word, 35 with many others,
for the third, altare. Yet in c. 108 we have altari astitistis.

4 Spiritaliter intelligenda eruut vobis. ssy the method of interpretation, to
which allusion 1135 been already made, Gildas will have the desolation described
by the prophet understood in 3 spiritual sense ; but the best motive of his work
is also made evident thereby z he warns lest the souls of the priests themselves
should become dried up in such 3 general spiritual drought.

⁵ Qui deservitis Domino. As in qui deservitis altario, the original 11616 15
οἱ λειτουργοῦντες, denoting 1111131 service.

⁶ This last sentence represents the reading of the LXX. The Vulgate
implies 3 different Hebrew original.
