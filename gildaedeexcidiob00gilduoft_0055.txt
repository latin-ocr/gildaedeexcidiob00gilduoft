Chrysanthus, a Novatian bishop at Constantinople‚ who was drawn into the
episcopate against his will. His work as bishop began in 407, but before
that he had filled several public offices about the palace, and after being raised
to consular rank in Italy, was appointed by Theodosius the Great, Vicar of
Britain. In the tasks of this office he acquitted himself well (H. E, vii, 12).
It is just possible that in him we have one of the rnen employed by 'Uieodosius
in undoing the havoc caused by Maximus in Britain, which would mean repel-
ling the barbarians.

Theodosius died in 395, and from that time until his death in 408, Stilicho
was actual, though not nominal, ruler of the VVest. Claudian⁷s verse has preserved
many particular-s respecting this brave soldier and strong minister of Honorius,
and as the poems do not extend beyond the year 404, the frequent mention
of Britain found in them must refer to events anterior to that date. These may
be read in the Illon. Hz'st. Brit„ xcvii, xcviii, therefore Ι shall only quote the
following from the poem on the Gothic war (De Bello Gelicv, A.D. 402 or 403> :—

“ Venit et extremis legio praetenta Britannis
Quae Scoto dat frena truci, ferroque notatas
Pertegit exsangues Picto moriente figuras.''

We have, therefore, clear evidence that measures were taken to repress the
barbarians of the North after the death of Maximus, and before 402. Iam
further tempted to add the following quaint translation given by Speed in his
Greal Brz‘laine, from the poem ‘⁴ On the First Consulship of StilichO,⁷' of the
year 400. Britain is made to say of Stilicho——

“ When Seas did foame with strokes of Oai-es,

That beat the billowes backe,

His force effecting with his care5‚
Prevented still my wracke ;

He bade me sear no forraine powers,
That Picts or Scots could make,

Nor of the Saxons that on Seas,
Uncertaine courses take.⁷'

The reference to Picts and Scots by Claudian may be pushed back some years
earlier even than 40οἢΘ It is, however, unimportant to make any endeavour by
way of fixing any precise year. We find it proved for us that help was actually
sent to Britain by the Empire during the very time it was possible so to send
it. Gildas is in this way vindicated as to the genuineness of his facts, though his
mode of describing them may certainly be still open to suspicion. He has been
accused of confusion, because historians have sought in his narrative what it
could not have entered his thought to narrate. For instance, it was supposed
that in c, 17 he was describing the successes of Theodosius (Senior), which took
place in 368 3 but because Gildas places the events of that chapter subsequent

 

ᾗ It is interesting to remember, once more, that the xxth legion, Valeria
Victrix, established hitherto at Chester, was recalled to the continent by Stilicho
about 402 ; but Claudian⁷s poem, De Bello Getico, proves that it had, before its
withdrawal, done service against the Picts ancl Scots‚ as formerly, under Hadrian
and Pius, as well as in the expeditions of Severus, it had taken part in the same
work (see Mommsen’s Das Romisclze Heer in Brz'lcmnien, s. 27).
