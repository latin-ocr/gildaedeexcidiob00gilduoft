103 But listen also to that which he says to the Thessalonians:
For neither were we at any time among yon with word offlatterys, as 1 Thess. η’, 5-8
ye know, nor in occasion Of covetonsness ‚· nor seeleing glory of men,
neither from yon nor fi‘onz others, when we might be a bnra'en
5 as other apostles (ff Christ. But we became lilee little ones, hahes
λ among yon, or as when a nnrse cherisheth her little ones, being
aſj‘ectz'onately desirons of yon, we were well pleased to inzpart nnto
yon, not the Gospel only, bnt also oar sonls. If you preserve this
feeling of the apostle, in all things you know also how legitimately

fication, that ye ahstain from fornication, and each one ofyon know
how to possess his own vessel in honour and sanctzfication, not in the
passion of lnst, even as the Gentiles who know not God ,· and let no
15 man over-reach or wrong his brother in the matter, because the Lora'
is avenger in all these things. For God called ns not anto nnclean-
ness bnt nnto sanctification. Thercfore he who despiseth these things,
despiseth not man, bnt God. Who also of you has circumspectly

mostly rises.

25 spirit of prophecy, respecting you and men like you, when plainly
writing to Timothy. For know this, that in the last days dangerons ΙΙ Tim. iii,

but we have in this place again a piece os Old Latin, because Gildas, having
before him a New Testament codex from which to copy his extracts from the
Epistle5‚ must be quoting a well-known verse of the Psalter from inemory.

Gildas. Vulgate.
Odivi congregationem malignorum .· Odivi ecclesiam malignantium .·

The Versio antiqua of Sabatier, taken from Cod. Sangerm„ also gives
