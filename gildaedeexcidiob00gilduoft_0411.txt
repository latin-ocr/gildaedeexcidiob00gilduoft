be seared, and obeyed him after hearing his acceptable preaching.
In the time of king Trifinus, he preached every Lord’s day in his
church on the sea-shore, in the district of Pepidiauc, with a count-
less number of people listening to him. And when he was once just
beginning to preach, the words of the preaching were checked in
the preacher himself; and the people were struck with amazement
at the wonderful retention. On finding this, St. Gildas bade all
who were present to go out, that he might be able to know whether

 

several times called Britannia by Asser, a contemporary of Rhodri's three sons,
so that the divisions belonging to Cadell, Anarawd and Merfyn would, ccl that
time be called lrz'a regna Britanniae. Caradoc may thus, unconsciously, have
used a phrase belonging to the old order. The threefold division is spoken of
as ancient (antiquitus) by Giraldus Cambrensis in his Descriplio Kambriae3
his names also are, Venedotia, Sudwallia, and Powisia, though they are not
termed regna by him (vol. vi, p. 166, Rolls Series).

¹ Pepidiauc regione. Giraldus Cambrensis, writing somewhat more than
half a century after Caradoc, mentions Pebidiauc several times; he calls it
the “ Cantred⁷' of Peffidiauc, asserting that it had been given to the Church
of Menevia by the pious generosity of the princes of South &Vales : previous to
the time of Bishop Bernard it had extended as far north as Fishgard (De Iure
el Statu Men. Eccl. ll, vol. iii, p. 154). Elsewhere he speaks of terra de Pehi-
diauc, quae adiacet spleneviae<ltinen Kambriue, ii, 7 ; p. 127). This must have
been the ancient name for the part afterwards called Dewisland‚ because in
the list of Cantrefs and Cymwds, given in sllyv. Arch„ p. 733 (znd edit), and
Y Cymmrodor, ix, p. 330, the Cantrev of Pebidiog is said to contain the
Cymwds of MynyW, Penkaer‚ and Pabidyawc. On the name, we may refer to
George Owen⁷s Pembrokeffzire, p. 351 3 cf. p. 398.

That Gildas should be found here in the very same neighbourhood as Dewi
Sant agrees with Irish accounts of the saints who crossed over to benefit by
the instruction of David and Gildas. We have previously mentioned Finian,
the founder of the leading Irish monastery, who is said to have remained long
with David, Gildas, and Cathmael at Kil-muine, in &Vales By Kil-muine we
can only understand what would be written in Welsh as Cil-mynyw‚ the Cz'l
(Latin cella), or cell, of Menevia. Strange things are told ofthe Irish saint

Brendan, and his wonderful voyages; but none more wonderful than some
incidents of his life when at the Welsh monastery with his master Gildas

(see p. 420). The continuous preaching, every Sunday‚ described by Caradoc
here, should be regarded as a genuine local tradition of that burning energy
which made Gildas a great revival preacher of his day. The church by the
seaside is called the Church of Kaemorva <or Kairmorva-the MS. reads

Kanmorva) by Giraldus (De Vita S. Davidis, p. 381, vol. ii, Rolls Series).

¹2 Trifinz‘ regis. Ussher's MS. reads Trisuni3 the name is found in the
Genealogies printed in YCymmrodor‚ ix, p. 171, Trz'plzmz map Clolri and
Trzplzun map Regin, but referring, of course, to a much later personage.
