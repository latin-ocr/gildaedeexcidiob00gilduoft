Τίτε Lorz'ca of Gildas. 297

varying between 640 of the Clw‘onz'con Scotorum and 663 of the
A nnals of Ulster and Α nnals oftlze Four M asters.1 Now, the date of
Laidcenn’s death is given as 660, so that, if the mortalitas leuius anni
means the pestilence osone of these years in the seventh century,
Laidcenn may have seen the beginning of it, and the Lorica would,
naturally, be regarded as his. It could not be a Hymn by Gildas.
The subscription in Mone's MS. (K) of the ninth century ascribes
its composition to Laidcenn ; the Cerne MS. (C), also of the ninth
century, in its Preface2 says that ‘⁶ Loding sang this λογίαι three
times a day ;'’ the oldest MS. (N), the Book of Nnnnamz'nster, which
belongs to the eighth century, somewhat remarkably, says that
“ Lodgen appointed (constituit) this Lorica (for use Ρ) in the year of
danger, and it is said the virtue of it is great if sung three times a
day.'' Neither C nor N seems to assign the authorship to Laidcenn.
Constituit, which in ecclesiastical language is so frequently equiva-
lent to ordinare, can scarcely be regarded as implying that “ Lodgen”
composed the Hymn, and agrees well with what the Preface of the
Leablmr Breac (B) attributes to him, if, as is probable‚ he be the
same person as Laidcenn. The Preface of K, a ninth-century MS„
therefore remains in disagreement with the preface of Β, a MS.
not older than. the fourteenth century. The former assigns it to
“ Lathacan the lrishman‚” the latter to Gillas, or Gildas, the Welsh-
man; but it also mentions the Irishman as performing a work
analogous to that of constitnit in the oldest Ms„ that is to say, he
comes from Gildas to Ireland, and places the Lorica sor use on the
altar of St. Patrick, “to make us safe.” From the agreement of
these two we may sasely gather that the Lorz'ca became known in
Ireland, and even in English monasteries, through Laidcenn ; but
the Preface printed below from the Leabllar Breac may be con-
siderably older than the MS. which contains it, though certainly
not so old as the Hymn itself, whether the authorship be ascribed
to Gildas or to Laidcenn. The Preface suggests also, when thus
regarded, that an early Irish tradition connected the origin of the
Hymn with Wales, and, naturally with Gildas, the leading represen-
tative of the Church of Wales as known to Irishmen. Here the

 

¹ Dr. Stokes‚ on p. 119 (Rev. Celt.), remarks: ‘⁴ It will be seen that the
Annalists seldom agree in their dates, and it is certain that many, perhaps most,
of these dates are erroneous ; but the amount oferror in each case is not impor—
tant.'' The Anmzls of Ulster are said by O’Donovan (Four Mnsters, Ι, xlviii)
to be antedated by one year up to 1014. Dr. MacCarthy asserts that from A.D.
494 to 1019 the date of every item in the Ammls os Four Masters is wrong.
