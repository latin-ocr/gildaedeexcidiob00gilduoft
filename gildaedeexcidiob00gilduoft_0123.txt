crnshed ont thereos ,· since the stars of heaven and their splendenti* shall
not spread their light ‚· the snn shall be darhened in its rising, and the
moon not shine in her time. And l shall visit the evils of the world,

the nnfaithfnl to become qniet, and the hanahtiness cys the strong will J

lay low. Again : Behold the Lord shall waste the earth, and snake it [δαὶ-ἀ] -’ ' ·

empty, and afflict its face, and scatter abroad the inhabitants therecff,
and it shall be, as the people, so the priest‚· and as the servant so his
10 master,- as the maid, so her mistress ‚· as the bnyer, so he who sells ‚-
as the lender, so he who bom‘ows ‚· as he who claims a debt, so he who
is in debt. The land shall be utterly dispersed, and shall be dc-
spoiled with pillaging. For the Lord hath spoken this word .· T he
earth hath monrned and hath faded away ‚· the world hath faded
15 away ‚· the loftiness of the people of the earth hath been weak’ened,

and the earth hath been brought to nonght by its inhabitants, be-
canse they have transgresses! the laws, have changed the right, and

have broken the everlasting covenant. T herefore shall a curse devonr
the earth.
