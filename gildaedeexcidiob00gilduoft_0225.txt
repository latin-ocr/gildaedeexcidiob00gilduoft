against the prophets that see lies, and those who speale vain things.
They shall not be in the discipline of my people, and shall not be written
in the writing of the house of lsrael, and they shall not enter into the
land of Israel, and ye shall know that J am the Lord. lsVherefore they
5 have led astray my people‚ saying: The Peace of the Lord, and there
is no Peace of the Lord. This man buildeth a wall, and they daub
it, and it shall fall. After some more words: Woe anto those that Ezek. xiii.
sew pillows beneath every elbow, and fashion veils upon every head of 18'19'
every age, to subvert souls. Subverted are the souls of my people,
10 they took possession of their souls, and profaned me to my people for a
handful of barley and a piece of bread to slay the souls that should
not die, and to free the souls that should not live, while ye speah to
the people as they listen to vain speeches. Below also : Son of man Ezek. xxii.
say .· T hou art the land that is not watered, nor hath rain come upon ²4-26'
15 thee in the day of wrath, the land in which the princes are like
raging lions in the midst of her, ravening the prey, devouring souls
by their might and taking wwardsj thy widows have been made
many in the midst of thee, and her priests have despz'sed my law and
were polluting mine holy things. They distinguished not between the

clean, and veiled their eyes from my sabbaths‚ and I was profaned
in the midst of them.

walhed nprzghtly‚ and stood before my face wholly for the times 30‘31'
25 of the land, that I should not in the end destroy it, and have not
found. And l have poured out against it my soul in the fire of my
anger to consume them. Their ways have l brought upon their head,
saith the Lord. After a while: And the word of the Lord came Ezek. xxxiii,
anto me saying, S on of man, speale to the children of my people, and 1-9'
30 say anto them .· The land into which J bring a sword, and the people
of the land talee a man from among themselves, and place him for
them as a watchman‚ if he see the sword coming over the land, and
blow the trumpet and signifi! nuto the people‚ and he that heareth
hear the voice of the trumpet and not observe, and the sword come
35 and seiae him, his blood shall be upon his own head. Because, when
he heard the voice of the trumpet, he did not observe, his blood shall
be upon himself. And this man who watched over his own soul hath

delivered it. And the watchman, if he see the sword coming, and
signifi! not by the trumpet so that the people observe not, and the

40 sword coming take a soul from among them, and that soul is tahen
