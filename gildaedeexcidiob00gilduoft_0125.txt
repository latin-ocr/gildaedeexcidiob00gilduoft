The Ruin of Britain. 113

the pit, they shall be shut in prison there, and after many days shall
they be visited. The moon shall blush, and the sun be confouna'ed,
when the Lora' of hosts shall reign in mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
and shall be glorifiea' in the presence of his elders.
46 After a while, giving a reason why such things should be threat-
ened, he says thus ε Behola' the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it lsaialz lix, 1-4·
cannot save ‚· neither His ear become heavy, that it hear not. But
your iniquities have separated between you and your God, ana' your
sins have hid H is face from you, that He should not hear. For your
10 hands are defilea' with blood, ana' your fingers with iniquity .· your
lips have spoken salsehooa', and your tongue uttereth wichedness.
There is none that calleth for justice, nor is there that jua'geth truly‚
but they confide in nothingness,· they speah vanities, they have con-

and uprzghtness could not enter. T ruth hath become in oblivion,· ana'
25 he who hath departe'd from evil, hath become open to prey. And the
Lord saw it, aud it was not pleasing in His eyes that there is no

of Isaiah the Prophet.
30 Now with equal attention listen to him who, before he was

formed in the womb, was foreknown, was sanctified and appointed
a prophet among all nations also, before he parted with his
mother—listen, 1 say, to Jeremiah, what he has pronounced
concerning a foolish people and stiff-necked kings. He begins

35 his utterances gently in this manner. And the word os the Lordser. ii, 1, 2.
came unto me, saying, Go and cry in the ears of jerusalem, aud
