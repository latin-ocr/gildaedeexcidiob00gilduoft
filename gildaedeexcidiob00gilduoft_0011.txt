rendering of the Greek of the Septuagint3 so far is this the case
that the Greek version itself, for the quotations made from Job,
Ezekiel, the Minor Prophets‚ and some other books, becomes a no
unimportant part of the documentary evidence for the determina-
tion of readings. It has been so employed in this edition.

The FRAGMENTS seem to throw a distinct and pleasing light
upon the man’s character, and the PENITENTIAL will illustrate the
beginnings of a peculiar mode of church discipline. Every one
of the pieces named, after the De Excidio, has been made the
subjectos searching critical examination, as regards the text, by
Dr. Wasserschleben or the late Mr. Henry Bradshaw, by Dr.
Heinrich Zimmer and the editors of The [risle Liber Hynmorum.
The Introductions and Notes in this edition will endeavour to
deal with the subject-matter of each.

An unprejudiced student of Gildas comes back to his writings
with the feeling that something of value may, and ought to, be
got out of them; my own frequent reading of these has led me
to a higher appreC1ation of the man and his work. To my mind,
it is a grave mistake to call Gildas a “historian’': neither Colum-
banus, writing about forty years after his death, nor Alcuin, in the
last quarter of the eighth century, regard him in this light. The
fashion began with the Venerable Beda; for him, in the early
parts of his Historia Ecclesz'astz'ca, and, for the writers of the
Saxou Chronz'cle also apparently, Gildas was the sole “historian '³
(historicus eorum). Mediaeval writers, who invariably term him
lzz'storz'ogmphus, helped to make the idea a fixed one. But Gildas
would never have regarded himself as a “historian'': he is a
preacher‚ a revivalist, who will “attempt to state a few facts’'
(pauca dicere conamur), by way of illustrating his message, that
divine anger must visit with punishment a sinning people and
priesthood.

Ι could not but feel interested, in reading “The Letters of
Cassiodorus,” by Mr. Hodgkin‚ to notice what he says of “the
inflated and tawdry style '' of that strenuous and successful
administrator, and exceptionally far-sighted Roman statesman.
In the volume mentioned, which contains a resume‘ of letters in
the Variorum Libri XII, Mr. Hodgkin gives an amu :ing specimen
of how Cassiodorus, as prime minister, could ‚write in the name of
Theodoric to Faustus, the Praetorian prefect, who was dawdling
over an order to ship corn from Calabria and Apuleia to Rome.
Reprimanding the lazy official, Theodoric, by his minister, is made
to say: “Why is there such delay in sending your swift ships to
traverse the tranquil sea? Though the south wind blows and the
rowers are bending to their oars, has the sucking-fish fixed its
teeth into the hulls through the liquid waves, or have the shells
of the Indian sea, whose quiet touch is said to hold so firmly that
the angry billows cannot loosen it, with like power fixed their lips
