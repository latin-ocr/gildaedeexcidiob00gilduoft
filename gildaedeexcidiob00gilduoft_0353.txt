The Life of Gillias. 341

He also sent to St. Gildas, begging him to corne to him, and
promising that he would obey his instructions in everything‚ if he
should come and restore church order in his realm; for almost
every man in that island had abandoned the catholic saith. When,
5 therefore, Gildas, the most saintly soldier of Christ, heard this, he
equipped himself with the heavenly weapons, and directed his
course to Hibernia to preach Christ. Now it happened on a cer-
tain day, when he was going to the king’s palace, that a certain
man, sick of the palsy, met him, whom his parents were leading
10 about, asking alms of the inhabitants of the country. Seeing
him and taking compassion upon him, St. Gildas bent on his

knees, and uttered a prayer to the Lord on his behalf. He then
approached the wretched man's vehicle, and said: ln tlze name
of our Lord sesus Christ, stand uprzgrlzt On tlly feet, (md receive
15 from tlte Lord tlzy former healtlz. He at once received his bodily
strength and was made whole; and, exclaiming with a loud voice,
he began to magnify the name of the Lord, and to repeat lofty
praises ofthe holy man, saying that he would go with him whither-
soever he should wish. The saint could not endure this, and said
20 to him: See that llum comest not wille me, but return home, and
cease not to extol 2⁴]ae mercy of the Lord who lmtla restored 2‘0 lllce
tlzy healtlz. But the man more and more burst out in praise
of him, and declared to all whom he met, saying: Come, come
ye all, and see a hely man ο] God, wlzo llas restored lo me the
25 lzealtll (ff my baasi! and of my soal. Then St. GildaS, as 116 carecl
not to be the object of such popularity and applause from the
people, departed forthwith from them, and went away secretly that
he might not be recognized, and concealed himself.
12 In a few days after 116 was found by some men of noble birth
30 who had once been known to him, and was introduced by them to
king Ainmericus. When the king saw him, he begged him with
many entreaties‚ and with an offer of numerous gifts asked him to
remain with him, and, as he had previously enjoined him, to restore
church order in that island ; for all, from the greatest to the least,
35 had altogether lost the catholic faith. Then St. Gildas, protected
with tlte slzz'eld of com‘age and tlte lzelmet of salvation, went round
all the territories of the Hibernians and restored the churches‚

of Ulster to 569, so also in the Fozcr Alsaster53 the Clzron. scot. gives 571 ; and
