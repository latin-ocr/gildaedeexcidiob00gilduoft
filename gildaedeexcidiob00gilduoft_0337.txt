a part of Britain, took its name from a certain river called the
Clut, by which that district is, for the most part, watered. Indeed,
amongst other matters which St. Gildas himself has written
about the miseries and transgressions and ruin of Britain, he has,
5 at the beginning, said the following words about it ; Britain, says
he, is renownedfor its twice ten and twice sonr cities, and is embel-
lzslied by not a few castles. It was also not improbably provided and
adorned willa defences in tlte ἴση] of walls and serraled towers and
gates, and wille lzouses too, wliose tops, witta their strong structure,
10 are seen rising witlt a tlzreatening lzezgrlzt to heaven. lt is famous
also for its wide-spreading fields and its liills sitnated in pleasant
positions, and adopted for excellent tz‘llage‚· and for its mountains,
excellently advantageons for tlte alternate pasturage of cattle, and
rendered pleasing to man's eye by flowers of various kinds, lilee a
15 cliosen bride bedeck’ed witli divers jewels. lt rejoices in numerous
lncid fonntains from whicli brooles issue fortli willa <gentle murmur,
and wln‘cla afford to wemy travellers tlie sweet assurance of sleep. lt
is likewise enriclied by tlte mouths of two noble rivers, tlte T stanles
and tlte Severn, like two arms, along wlzicli, in days gone by, foreign
20 luxuries were conveyed in boats to Britain, and it is watered by tlte
flow of other smaller streanis. With this clear description, and
with the advantages of the place as well as of the country from
which the aforesaid venerable and holy man sprang, let, at last.
with the help of God, his life be written.
2 His father, Caunus, is said to have also had four other sons.
One was Cuillum, a very active man in war, who, after his father's

 

piece of detail almost tempts one to conclude that the writer, or more probably
the original biographer, was personally acquainted nith those parts that are
now South Radnor and Pembroke. But the way in which the facts are stated,
though so common as to be almost universal with English writers of high
learning, appears to me quite unhistorical. It is true that to speak of churches
dedicated to St. Martin, for instance, is quite appropriate at a very early period ;
but to employ the same idea ancl language in the case of the VVelsh llan
involves a misconception. When 1 meet (to take an ordinary instance) with
Llamzrmon, in Flintshire and Carnarvonshire, or with more than one Llczngybi
or Llcznddewi, I ought to say that some Garmon, or Cybi, or Dewi had founded
a llczn, that is a small monastery, at the place so indicated—not that the church
there is “dedicated'' to the men whom history knows as Garmon, Cybi, and
Dewi. We should also not forget that many such names (Garmon and Dewi
certainly) were very common as proper names of persons. The Vitae supply
us with numerous proofs of what> is here maintained, e.g., Louna Pauli id est
monasterinm Pauli ( Vita molimina), in monasterio sno Lan Cors (Book of
Llcmddv, pp. 238, 242). Most of these llans afterwards became churches,
