5 Accordingly, with wonderful virtue, the old man begins to till
the island thus enlarged for him, and to sow seeds of corn in the
fertile fieldS. When the glad buds of the fruits began to sprout,
the sea-birds fiocked together and began to destroy them. On

Sseeing this, the father Hildutus commanded his disciples to scare
and drive them away, and each of them in his own day, to guard
the cornfields. MVhen the day had come on which St. Paul was
to keep watch over the field, there arrived, in greater numbers
than usual, a hostile throng of birds, which kept devastating the

10 cornfield everywhere by plucking the ears of corn. Paul, however,
ayouth of wonderful activity‚ kept running hither and thither,
shouting loudly, and strove his best to scare them away, but did
not succeed. At last then, quite worn out, he calls his comrades
to his aid, even Gildas of blessed memory, and the venerable

15 Samson, rousing them with words to this effect: Help me,
brethren, llelp me, most beloved brethren, and avenge willa mc
tlte loss infliclcd upon our master. For lo! a llorde (ff euemies is
consamz'ng faV aad wide, and eatz’ng azeray tlze cornfield of θην
tcaclzer. Let, therefore, tlae z’nsatz'able plunderer that llas laid waste

20 oar master’s corn pay tlte penalty that is lais dne. At this word
his comrades fly ‚to his help ; and the holy boys, after calling upon
the name of Christ, gather together the multitude of wild birdS,
and then, filled with the power 01 God, drive them before them
like flocks of idle sheep. But when they had reached the old

25 man’s dwelling, the captured wild birds, on being hemmed in, send
up their cries to heaven. Hearing their noise and din, the aged
man comes out from his oratory and beholds the power 01 God.
He wondered not a little at such great saith in the hearts of the
boys, and said to them: Let tlze birds go, my som, let tlte birds

30 go away free: let z‘t suffice tlzat you lzave tlms pmzz‘slled them.
Let llzem go away free, and let tlzem 720 more, 2¹72 tlze name of tlte
Lord, presume to damage oms comzfields. And so, not daring to
despise the old man's command, the birds, when loosed, departed
far away, and no further presumed to lay waste the cornfields

35 in that island. That island is called, up to this day, Llanilltud

(the Llan 01 Illtud).

 

Pz'r.’' We know that the monastery, if not the island, was called the lanua
(llan) of Illtud, Llan-Illtud, at the time when this Vita was first written3 in
the days of Giraldus‚ the island was also called Ynys Pyr. On the mainland,
we learn from Owen's Pembrokeslzire (passim) how Maynaur Pir (Maenor Pyr)
had been Anglicised into lllaner hyr or Manerbier 3 in F enton's Pembrokeslare it
is Alanorbeer. Is it not possible that, as the memory of Illtud had well-nigh, if
