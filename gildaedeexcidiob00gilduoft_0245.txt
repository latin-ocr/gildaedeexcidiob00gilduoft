proves the freedom exercised by different countries, at first by individua]
churches, there grew certain definite points of agreement. These features of
similarity suggest to us a universalism of order as well as of doctrine, which
every student desimus to gain a true representation of Church life will keep in
mind, as well as the points of difference. The presumption is that congrega-
tional worship with its liturgy on the Lord⁷s Day, by the sixth century was the
same in Gaul as in Ireland, in Spain as in Britain ; so also would be the rite
of ordination for the ministry of the Church ; the same, yet with many vatia-
tions. Organisation seems, in its advance, to have been more affected by
geographical and political causes than ritual. Yet there was, on the whole,
greater and more effective one-ness in the Church at that time than could be
found in any socia] or political organization ; and this is one reason, it may
be said in passing, how true it is that, “ Church history is world history.''

3. We must first gather all that can be gathered from the meagre references
to be found in these chapters of Gildas. He speaks of benedictio—*that is, the
prayer, “by which the hands of priests orministers (deacons ?) are consecrated.”
Properly speaking, the benedictio, in all the forins we have, is always a prayer,
the words used being precative ; but there is assumed in all, that the peculial·
blessing invoked, is also conferred by the special act of prayer. The mention
of “hands '³ here implies a special rite. Duchesne, in his work Orzgines du
Culte Chre‘lien, mentioning this very phrase, speaks as follows : ‘⁶ Gildas, Liber
Querulus, parle cl'une benediction qua initicmlm' sacerdolzmz vel ministrorum
manus. Cette expression semble viser une rite special, probablement une
onction, accompli sur les mains des pretres et des diacres. L⁷onction des mains
pour ces deuxordres se rencontre dans les livres liturgiques anglo-saxons du
dixie'me et du onzieme siecles,'’ p. 356 vi. I am led to think that the learned
French writer has somehow not quite caught the whole meaning of Gildas'
words; he understands sam-doles vel mz'm'slri as meaning presbyters and
deacons. But we find that, unless otherwise limited, sacerdos in this work
denotes bishop, or implies priesthood as including both bishop and presbyter.
In any way, bishops must be included under sacerdotes in the present passage,
because the words of Matth. xvi, 16—18‚ were read ‘⁸ on that day'' (audistis etiam
illo die, c. 109). These words, with their reference to the Keys of the King-
dom of Heaven‚ and the power of binding and loosing, may, of course, apply
to presbyters‚ yet Gildas generally connects such ideas with the office of
bishops as “successors of Peter.⁷⁷ Further, the men addressed by the writer,
though ordained in the correctest manner as prescribed by the Church, are
said to be “enemies to God, not bishops; veterans in wickedness, not suc-
cessors of the holy apostles.'³ In seeking a more exact meaning of sacerdotes
vel ministri, two interpretations are possible. In the first place, we bring to
mind how instances are to be found in the Latin of the New Testament, and
ecclesiastical writers, of vel as the equivalent of et (see p. 157); in that case, the
meaning would be “priests (ie, bishops and presbyters) and deaconS.⁷’ The
inclusion of diaconi in one of the lessons (c. 109) may well favour the explana-
tion which sees a reference to the diaconate here in the term, frequently so
used, ministri. In the second place, if vel have its usual meaning, we are tied
to the meaning “priests or (if you prefer) ministers,'' which receives some
confirmation from the more solemn “ Dei ministri '² of the same sentence.
