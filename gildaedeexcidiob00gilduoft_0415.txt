to no king, not even to Arthur. He used to harass the latter, and

to provoke the greatest anger between them both. He would
often swoop down from scotland, set up conflagrations, and carry

off spoils with victory and renown. In consequence, the king of
5 all Britain, on hearing that the high-spirited youth had done such
things and was doing similar thingS, pursued the victorious and
excellent youth, who, as the inhabitants used to assert and hope,
was destined to become king. In the hostile pursuit and council
of war held in the island of Minau, he killed the young plunderer.
10 After that murder the victorious Arthur returned, rejoicing greatly
that he had overcome his bravest enemy. Gildas, the historian of
the Britons, who was staying in Ireland directing studies and
preaching in the city of Armagh, heard that his brother had been
slain by king Arthur. He was grieved at hearing the news, wept
15 with lamentation‚ as a dear brother for a dear brother. He prayed
daily sor his brother’s spirit3 and, moreover, he used to pray
for Arthur, his brother’s persecutor and murderer, fulfilling the

apostolic commandment, which says: Leve tlzose wlto persecute Lake vi, 27.
you, and do good to tlzem tltat lmte you.

6 Meanwhile, the most holy Gildas, the venerable historian, came
to Britain, bringing with him a very beautiful and sweet-sounding
bell, which he had vowed to offer as a gift to the Bishop of the
Roman Church. He spent the night as a guest honourably
entertained by the venerable abbot Cadocus, in Nant Carban‚

 

 

the administration of oaths is also related there, more at large than here. In
other Vitae we find tintinnabulum and clocca or clota (whence the &Velsh cloch),
even clocas and cloccum. Bells as old as the time of Columba (died 597) are
still preserved3 they are quadrangular in form, and made of sheet-iron (cf.
Johnstone⁷s Antiqq„ Reeves’ Adamnan, p. 33). These bells called the
brethren together, as we see from Adamnan's Vita Columbae, i, 8; Beda, H. E,
iv, 23.

4 Cczdoco. Cadoc is Abbot in the valley of Carban‚ or Nant Carban; in
the next section he is “ Abbot of the Clzztrclz of Nancarban ;'' neither of these
expressions is inconsistent with the use as well of Lan Carhan as a name
implying the monastery of which he was Abbot. Cadoc is here made contem-
porary with Gildas, and in the Vita Cadaei with David as well, and so in other
Vitam we canthus see the confusion that too frequently reigns in these legendary
wrstings, when we remember that he is also represented as the one to whom
the conversion of Illtud was due. In Irish hagiology, “the three holy men,
Gildas, David, and Cathmael‚'' are named together, and Catmail is known from
the Life to have been another name which Cadoc bore (p. 25). The two names
seem to have the same element in their first part—Cat-ocus, Cat-mail, and both
are used in the Book oleanaciv as names os Llangarfan. See Introduction.
