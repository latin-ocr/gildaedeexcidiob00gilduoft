The Life of Gz'ldas. 397

He used to fast like the hermit Antony τ most thoroughly devoted
to religion, he used to pray clad in goat's skin. If anything was
given him, he would forthwith expend it upon the poor. He
abstainecl from milk—foods and honey: flesh was hateful to him:
5 fresh-water herbs were rather a favourite dish with him: he ate
barley—bread mixed with ashes, and drank spring water daily.
He used not to take a bath, a habit very much in favour by his
nation. Thinness appeared in his face, and he seemed like a man
suffering under a very serious sever. It was his habit to go into a
10 river at midnight, where he would remain unmoved until he had
said the Lord's Prayer three times. Having done this, he would
repair to his oratory and pray there on his knees unto the divine
majesty until broad daylight. He used to sleep moderately, and
to lie upon a stone, clothed with only a single garment. He used
1³ to eat without satisfying his wants, contented with his share of the
heavenly reward; the longing of his heart was after heavenly
rewards.
4 He warned men to contemn, he advised them to scorn mere
transitory things, He was the most renowned preacher through-
20 out the three kingdoms of Britain. Kings feared him as a man to

 

Like things are said of Columba (cf. Vita Ill, 17), and others, of whom a list
made by the Bollandists is given in Reeves' Adamnan, p. 219. To these we
may add, as to severity of abstinence, the rigours described in the Life of Dewi
Sant, and notably the impressive picture of Aidan and his disciples given by
Beda z quod non aliter, quam vivebat cum suis, lpse docebat. Nil enim lucius
mundi quaerere, nil amare curabat.

3 Per tria regna Britanniae. On the meaning of Britannia in the twelfth
century, cf. Romania, Janvier, 1899. Asser, who died in 909, in liis Lzfi ofAlsred
tlte Great, relates how the King urged him to remain “in Saxony''; but owing to
his own reluctance to leave the Welsh St. David's, was at last prevailed upon to
spend six months with Alfred, or alternately “three months in Britannia and
three in Saxony.'' Britannia in the tenth century, we conclude, meant wales.
The Book oleamffiv, written in the twelfth century, seems to vary in its deno-
tation ofthe name: the early parts, which contain accounts ofDubricius‚ Samson,
Teilo, Oudoceus, etc., must be taken as denoting the country of the Brythons‚
without any reference to the English. But other parts, which are considerably
later than the facts they relate, employ Britannia, also, as applied to the parts
peopled by the ancient inhabitants. For instance, the clause, confirmatum apos-
tolita auctoritate, proves that the privilegimn described on p. 1 18 is late, yet “the
kings and princes of Britannia,'' mentioned in the same passage, are really
kings and princes of W'ales. On p. 192 we have even such words as “from both
parts of Anglia and Britannia„ (ex utraque parte Anglie et Britanm'e). N ever-
theless, the same volume speaks of kings and princes of “ Cymry³> (p. 120);
also of Eclgar, as rex tocius Britanniae, though he is also called rest* Anglorusn.
