236 De Excidio Britanniae.

might help us to understand the simplest canons that regulated the con-
ferring of orders in this island. In the Vita Samsom's there may be an echo of
some special usage. The saint had already been duly ordained deacon and,
two years afterwards, presbyter, the event being each time signalised by that
“prodige classique,'⁷ the dove which alighted on the head and was visible only
to a select few. “Then the festival was at hand when it was necessary that
bishops should come together in that monastery, for the ordination of a bishop,
as was wont ....... And when the bishops who came for the ordination
had arrived, bringing with them two to be ordained, and desiring to ordain a
third, according to the custom handed down from antiquity‚ but as yet ignorant
who he should be-—ccs it is tlze czcstom tlzere tlzat three should be ordained by
tlcree bishops—during the following night the angel of the Lord came to bishop
(papam) Dubricius, and said : ‘ Know ye that Saint Samson must be the third
ordained by you! ⁷⁷* He is, of course, ordained with great joy, the dove from
heaven appearing again.

All this legendary colouring stands in strange contrast with the simple
account given by Gildas as a contemporary, which may be supplemented here
by the aid of the Alissale Francoruml* and the Statum Ecclesiae Antiqua, as
follows :

(ιι) XVhen a deacon is ordained, the Bishop addresses the people :

Beloved brethren ...... it is my desire that our brother (name) should be
promoted to the office of deacon in fellowship with us ; Ι desire to know whether you

think him worthy of this office, and, if your choice agrees with mine, confirm your
testimony by word of mouth (testimonium quod vultis vocibus adprobate).

W'hen the people assent by the response “He is worth ,³² the bishop invites
to common prayer. Holding his hands upon the head of the person ordained,
the bishop (qui eum benedicit) pronounces the prayer of benedicfion, beginning:
Domine sancte, spei, fidei gratiae et profectuum munerator, &m &a

Then follows the consecration of hands (consecratio manuum), accompanied
by the prayer given above.

(b) At the ordination of a presbyter, there is a similar address to the people,
but longer and more solemn. After the response Dignus est, the bishop invites
to prayer.

Let there be by us, brethren, common prayer, that this person, who is elected for
the help and profit of your salvation, may, by the concession of a divine gift, attain

to the blessing of the presbyterate ς that ,he obtain the priestly gifts by the favour of
His powers, so that he be not found unequal to the position.

During the benedictio which now follows, all the bishops present place
their hands upon the head of the ordinand ; and further, according to c. xci of
Statum Eccl. Ant„ two bishops hold an open codex of the Gospels over his
head.

This consecratory prayer is as follows :

Author of all holiness, whose true consecration is full benedietion (henuiictio), do
Thou, Lord, spread over this thy servant (name), whom we have dedicated by the

honour of the presbyterate, the hand of Thy bencdiction, so that in seriousness os
actions and judgment of his life, he may prove himself to be an elder (se csse
