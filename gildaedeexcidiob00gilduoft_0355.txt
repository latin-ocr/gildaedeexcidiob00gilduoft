instructed the whole body of the clergy in the catholic saith, that
they might worship the holy Trinity, healed the people who were
severely wounded by the bites of the heretics, and drove far away
from them the heretical conceits along with their authors. And
5 when now the harvest of the multitude of believers was growing in
the bosom of the mother church, and the thorns of the heretics had
been plucked off, the land, long sterile, was now fertilized by the
dew of heavenly grace, and brought forth more pleasing fruits
unto the knowledge of the heavenly calling. For as the catholic

10 saith was increasing, the country rejoiced at having won so great
a man for its patron. Afterwards the saintly man built many
monasteries in the said island, rearing in them not a few sons of
noble men, and fashioning them by the rule of a regular discipline.
And, that he might be able to present more disciples to the

15 Lord, being a monk, he now gathered monks to himself not
only from the ranks of the nobles, but also from among poor
orphans and bereaved persons; yea, in his compassion, he even
set free the captives who had been ensnared by the despotic
slavery of the pagam, and, as a good shepherd, triumphing over

20 himself, he strove to pay back to Him, faithfully doubled, the
talents entrusted him by the Lord. In short, he instructed by his
example and taught by his words the whole country of the Irish
and the English, and likewise of foreign nations: their peoples
and their nations everywhere up to this day revere with deep

25 honour his acts and his virtues,

13 After these events St. Gildas departed from Hibernia and
Britain, and left all his friends behind him. Then, setting out for
foreign parts, he directed his course to Rome, to plead the
merits of the holy apostles Peter and Paul, that, through their

30 intercession, he might be able to obtain from the Lord the remis-
sion of his sins and to continue steadfast in the service of God,
and be deemed worthy of being united to all the saints in the
heavenly country. But when, after finishing the praises of vigils
and matins, he went out at dawn on a certain day from the palace

35 of St. Peter, desiring, as was his wont, to go out and go round
the oratories of the rest of the saints in the city of Romulus,
and to seek their prayers, he was met by a certain man, sick
of the dropsy, swollen with the water of his dread disease, and
asking alms of him. St. Gildas said to him: I lmve 'no money
