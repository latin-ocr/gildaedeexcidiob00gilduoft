24 For the fire of righteous vengeance, caused by former crimes,
blazed from sea to 563, heaped up by the eastern band of impious
men ; and as it devastated all the neighbouring cities and lands, did
not cease after it had been kindled, until it burnt nearly the whole

5 surface of the island, and licked the western ocean with its red and
savage tongue. In this assault‚ which might be compared to the ,
Assyrian attack upon Iudaea of old, there is fulfilled in us also,
according to the account, that which the prophet in his lament
says :—
πο leey slave bm‘ut willa fire thy sanctnmy in tlze land, Psalm lxxiv, 7-
They slave defiled tlze labemmcle Of tley name ,·

and again,

O God, the gentiles leave come into illiue 2'nllel‘2’lam·e, Psalm lxxix, 1.

low with the frequent shocks of the battering rams; the in-
113111131115, along with the bishops of the church, both priests and
people, whilst swords gleamed on every side and flames crackled‚
were together mown down to the ground, and, sad sight! there

20 were seen in the midst of 5116615, 1116 bottom stones of 1011615 111111
1311 beam5 cast down, and 01 high walls, sacred 3113ι·5,113ς11161115,

sepulture of any kind save the ruins of houses, or the entrails 01

holy souls (11111 1361 there were many to be found holy), 11131 would

be carried by holy angels to the heights of heaven. For the vine-5

that rarely could be seen, according to the prophet, any cluster oflsaiah xxiv, 13·

reduced to life-long slavery3 (3) others took refuge in parts beyond sea3
(4) others betook themselves to hilly districts and the rugged sea-coasts.
These last are the reliquiae, the remnant, who before Gildas’ own time had,
with the assistance of their Uritish 1611011-601111111111611 (cives) succeeded in
wresting back several 611165 and districts from 1116 ,161111116 enemy. Two
remarkable successes came at a 111116 when a considerable part of the Saxons
