testimony upon the altar of that place; but they conveyed the
saint’s body to his own monastery, singing hymns and praises, and
a large crowd of people following them in joy and gladness, because
they had found the great patron and advocate of their country,
5 and their intercessor with the Lord. Now that day, which is the
11th of May, is kept and celebrated frozn that time up to our time
as a most solemn day among the provincials of Venetum (Vannes).
On that day, too, as we also have seen with our own eyes, the
Lord was wont to perform very many mighty deeds at his grave.
10 The saint's body, on the day we have previously mentioned, was
placed in the church which he himself had built on the ancient
fort of Reuvisium, where through the course of many years it
was kept and honoured in reverence by the whole nation of the
Bretons : for innumerable powers were wrought by the Lord.
32 NVhen the devout King Salomon was cruelly murdered by
wicked men, and the Bretons were quarrelling tog-ether and waging
civil wars, piratical Danes from abroad were devastating the
length and breadth of Brittany; for at that time the people os
Gaul were themselves also laying waste the sea-coast districts, and
20 spreading havoc like an irresistible hailstorm. And so, Brittany
which, as we have said, ‘was formerly called Letavia, was at that
time ravaged in a cruel manner as much by its own inhabitants as .
by foreignerS. Its cities‚ castles, churches, houses, monasteries
and nunneries were delivered up to fire, until the whole land, by
25 the judgment of God, was totally reduced to a wilderness and
waste desert. At that time Alanus and his brother, Fasquetenus,
were reigning over the province of Vannes. This province is
called Ero Guerec, from Guerecus; because, when Duke Belpo-
lenus and his army were slain, and Ebracarius, another duke

 

King Solomon, for instance, belongs to the year 874, whereas 'Waroch (or
Gueoecus), Belpolenus, and Ebracarius carried on their struggles to about 590 ;

yet these personages are placed before us as contemporaries (eo tempore) :-
Beppolenus, as Gregory of Tours gives the name, was dm· and general under
the Frankish King Chilperic in 579, so also was Ebrocharius (H. F„ v, 29 ;
x, 9—11). lt is probable that we have, further, a confusion of the Danish pirates
for the terrible Normans, at the time of whose great invasion in the tenth century
we have Alanus Magnus. and his grandson, another Alanus. The placing of
Alanus and Pasquetenus side by side with Warocus makes a strange medley.
