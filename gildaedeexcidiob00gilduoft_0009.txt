PRELIMINARY NOTE.

IN the present edition, it is intended to publish in a collected
form the works ascribed to Gildas for which, roughly speaking, a
date is assigned during the twenty years that elapsed between
AD. 540 and 560. The earliest references to Gildas that have come
down to us are the two made by Columbanus in his letter to St.
Gregory the Great, which must have been written between thirty
and forty years after the death of the British writer (aa, AD. 595—
600). In the first passage, he is mentioned as Gildas auctor who
has written against simony in bishops3 in the second, as having
been engaged in correspondence, rcspecting the monks who were
leaving their convents to become hcrmits, with Vennianus, prob-
ably Finian, the abbot of Clonard in Mcath, to whom Gildas sent
“an exccedingly noble answer’' (cl elrganlissimc illi reis-cressit).
Gildas is thus widely known, not very long after his death, as a
writer on ecclesiastical abusos, and as a correspondent whose
opinion on new and doubtful movements was highly valued in
Ireland.

[n a general INTRODUCTION Ι hope to deal with the questions
appertaining to the time and life of GildaS, the condition of Britain,
its people and its Church, at that time, and the authorship of the
several works named below. A map is also in preparation based
on that in Spruner's H7'5l0r.f1itlas, and Maps 15 (Roman Britain)
and 16 (England and Wales before the Roman Conquest), in
Parts Ι and XVI os The Hister. Atlas (ff Modern Europe. Oxford,
1896, 1898.

The works brought together in the volume, of which the present
is Part I, are the following :—

1. The DE EXCIDIO BRITANNIAE. This work has been mis-
takenly read as history; it is, really, in no way a history, nor
written with any object a historian may have. It may be regarded
as a kind of “Tract for the Times '’ of the sixth century. Ebert
(Gesclz. der Lz'leratur des Mz'ttelalsers) correctly terms the “De

Excidio'' a Teudeussclzzifl ‚· it is a message or a sermon addressed

to rulers and ecclesiastics by a servent monk, containing historica]
portions which are of undoubted value, because we possess no
other sor a partos the period to which they refer, but which in the
whole setting of their narration are coloured by the author's main
