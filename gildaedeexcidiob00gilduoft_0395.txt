struck by the same sudden scourge‚ and remained before the
church of Sarthau. But when his friends had come to the sacred
grave, they asked me to send over a nag to convey him thither.
And Ι did so. He was, therefore, brought 3 but because he could
5 not stand, he was placed in the house of some friends He was
dreadful to lool< at, and was vomiting blood. No one thought he
would live until the morrow, but was expected every moment
to die. The whole congregation came to visit him, and prayed to
the Lord on his behalf, and anointed him with oil. And so from
10 that hour he gradually returned to himself and recovered strength,
and in a few days after was quite restored to his health. His
friends, on returning to their own, told his wife that he was dead,
and had been buried at the church of St. Gildas. She came to give
alms for her husband's soul ; but she found him whom she expected
15 to see dead, not only living, but even in perfect health. Tlms,yea

him from that long-deserted place which he had long possessed,
returned to his old wiles, and by means of ghosts and horrid appari-
tions in the night, tried in every way to drive away those whom he

30 saw protected by the power of God. For, on a certain night, while
some young monks were sitting at table and repeating psalm5‚ the
adversary stood by them, and appeared playing with the candle-
light, often reaching out his hand between the two boys, drawing
it in again, and again reaching it out and drawing it in, doing this

35 incessantly until the light of the candle failed. Now, the outward
appearance of his hand and armS, the latter being barely visible,
was black and bristling with hairs. The boys were stricken with
great fear and utterly confused. One of the boys was named
Ratfredus, and the other Mangisus ; and the third youth who was

40 teaching them was called Rannulqu. Now, an old man, who was
