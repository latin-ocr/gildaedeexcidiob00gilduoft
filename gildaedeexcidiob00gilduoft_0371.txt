her to be joined in marriage to him. But Gildas, mighty in
glorious virtues, returned to his monastery.

22 When, therefore, the marriage had been celebrated, the tyrant
began to caress his beloved bride; and, as soon as he learnt that

Sshe had conceived, he meditated killing her as had been his
custom. But dreading the oath which he had sxvorn to St. Gildas,
he said to himself that he could not deceive a holy man. For he
feared to incur God's anger if he attempted to murder, with his
accursed sword, a lady whom he had received from the hands of

10 St. Gildas. But the devil, on the other hand, supplied him with
pretexts, declaring that he oughtnot to sear the holiness of St.
Gildas to such a degree aS, like a coward and a paltroon, to give
up, for the sake of a mere monk, accomplishing what he had set
his heart on. As the woman, in the meantime, perceived, by many

15indicati0n5„ that his heart was enraged against her because she
had conceived, she was struck with sear and secretly escaped.
When her wicked husband learnt this, he was now incensed
with greater anger, and pursued her. Having found her on the
roacl-side, hiding under some leaves—for she was wearied by her

he was stricken with deep grief, and sent at once, with great haste,

small fortification where the aforesaid tyrant used to dwell, desiring
to hear from him whether, as the rumour was, he had slain his wife

30 with his own hands. But when the tyrant saw St. Gildas approach-
ing, he charged the porter of the house to let the saint, on no
account, enter in to him ; for he knew that, through the murder of
his wife, -he had sinned against God and against the holy man.
But, although he was not ignorant of this, he nevertheless disdained

35 to request that the saint should prevail with God in prayer to grant
him a contrite and humble heart to do penance for the evil he had
done. When, therefore, St. Gildas had knocked long at the door
and no one opened to him, but rather he was mocked by those
within, he prayed unto God that, unless it was His will that that

40 man should be changed for the better, it might seem good to Him
to put an end to his wickedness. Having ended his prayer, he
went round the whole fortification in which the nefarious tyrant
