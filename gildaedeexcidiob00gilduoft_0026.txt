¹ Cildas is frequently said to have derived his geographical details from
Orosius (Hz'sl., i, 2, 77), but what the Spanish presbyter wrote may have been a
common-place in Gaul and Britain by the time of Gildas, and even from other
sources. Pliny gives the same length and breadth : insula habet z'n longo milia
passuum DCCC, z'n lato milia CC. The words of Orosius run thus: Britannia
occani insula per longum in boream exlendz'lur; a meridie Gallias habet . . . .
llaec insula hahet z‘n longo milio passuum DCCC, in lato CC 3 the measurements,
we see, are stated word for word the same as by Pliny. Orosius says, “towards
the north'’ as to the position of the island, in which he is followed by Gildas,
though in poetic language ; but Gildas has the further detail that with respect
to the continent Britain lies towards the west-north-west and the west (circium
occidentemque versus). The two writers may well be independent of one
another. ln the remainder of this description, Gildas draws upon his own
personal acquaintance with his native island, lingering over each detail, though
in faulty style. On the geography of Britain and Ireland in ancient writers,
see Bunbury, llz'slmy osAncz'ent Geograplzy, vol. i, p. 584, etc.

twenty cities in Britain. It is difficult to define the special character of the
towns and town population that had grown up in Britain under Roman rule.

quotations are from the edition of lee Bruts, by Mr. Gwenogfryn Evans ; the
very slight variations made will explain themselves as simply intended to render
the passages easier to read.
