was drawn up by an unknown author in Gaul sometime after A.D. 450. It
was extensively used in that country, and may be regarded as summarising
the ways and aims of church usages for Western Europe during the fifth
and sixth centuries, We have, indeed, no evidence of its use in Britain, but
it would be no great error to regard it as a very probable representation of the
qualifications expected in a British bishop, of his electiori and ordination to
office, and of his life and work afterwards ; we see in it also, as in 3 11111101, 3
picture of the clericus of every grade, his ordination and subsequent services
for the church in which he is constituted. Besides its bishop‚ presbyters
and deacons, 3 church (that is, 3 single community) has also its sub-deacons,
acolytes, exorcists, readers and ostiarii.

Canon 2, of the Statum Ecclesiae Antiqua, directs “that 3 131511013 when
in church and seated along with the presbyters, is to occupy 3 higher position
than they, but in the house is “to regard himself 35 1116 colleague of the
presbyters 3³¹ canon 3 “that 3 bishop is not to involve himself in private affairs,
but to devote his time to reading, prayer, and the preaching of God's word ;'’
canon 4, “that a bishop should have plain (vilem) [ιιι-11111116, 3 13001 table and
raiment, and should seek the authority of his dignified position, by saith and the
deserts of 3 good life.’² He must, by canon 10, not ordain clerics without
taking counsel of his co-presbyters, and is also to seek the assent and testimony
of the citizens 3 he is to hear no cause without the presence of his clergy ; the
sentence pronounced by him will not have validity unless confirmed in their
1316561166τ Canon 29 directs “that a cleric is to provide himself with food and
clothing by some handicraft (artficielo) or by agriculture, provided it be not to
the detriment of his office 3⁷³ so also canon 45, “all clerics strong enough to work,
must learn a trade and literature (lz'lteras).’⁷ Further, any donation, or sale, or
exchange of church property by the bishop‚ will 136 invalid, unless it be done by
the knowledge and the subscription of the clerics3 a bishop should bear in
mind to exhort dissentient brethren, whether 61611631 01 lay, to peace rather than
judgment3 the exorcists are to impose hands every day upon the enmgumem'
(those possessed by evil spirits> ; the priests are to impose hands at every time
of fast upon the penitent; priests are to resuse the offerings of those who
oppress the poor. (On ordination in Britain, 566 110165 10 cc. 106-108.)

These extracts, one may conjecture, serve to show us the kind of bishops
and clergy that Gildas had in view in the present work. The episcopal
office was evidently a position of great influence, open to gravest misuse
at all times, but, as described in this book, extensively degraded by pride,
laxity of morals, and extreme neglect of duty. It was also 3 position which
base-minded bishops could turn into a source of personal gain. Such men had
“bought their priesthoods'' for money; they were not averse to spending all
their wealth in order to secure the episcopal chair. Nevertheless, through the thick
cloud of dark invective, we can discern that the position of the church and its
ministry in Britain was indisputably strong. Gildas himselfconsesses that good
men were not wanting; there were, he avers, many whose pastoral life he
admired ; there was also a small remnant, lzardly known by tlte Clmrclc, whose
life he not only praised, but thirsted, some day before he died, to share3
these must have been the monks or, more strictly, the eremites.

Not 3 single word is said by Gildas respecting any council or synod to be
held for the redress of grievances, 01· reformation os morals. In Gaul during
the fifth and sixth centuries, synods formed an important factor of Church
