received by him. He gave Felix the aforementioned abbeys,
with all their appendages, begging him and earnestly entreating
him to rebuild them with the utmost zeal; ancl he promised to
make him numerous gifts when he had returned from ajourney

5 on which he was in haste to proceed. For that Prince was at that
time hurrying to go to Rome to pray. Accordingly he went, but
did not return, for he died on the journey. But the Prince had
commended the above-mentioned Felix, while he should be on his
journey, to the care of his wife, and his nobles, and also of his

10 brother Judicae'l, the bishop of Vannes, in whose diocese those
monasteries were.

35 ssut let us now return and relate the miracle wrought through
the blessed bishop, Paul, upon Felix. XVhen Felix, in the days of
the abbot Abbo, was in the abovcmentioned monastery of Fleury, he

15 was depressed with a severe illness‚ and given up in despair by the
physician. But, as he was watching and praying, the bishop‚ St.
Paul, appeared to him, sitting at his bedside, with a great light, and
said to him: How art thou, brother ,9 ον where dost tlzon feel tlze
pain ? He said: Who art thou, my lorti? l, said he, am tlze

20 bislzop Paul, whom slzoa werf secking ‚³7 Oli ,Ι my lord, said he, it is
in {leis side fleat {lle evil llas long troublea' me,⁸ and he showed
him the place. The other approached, and with his finger he gently
extracted from his side a putrid rib ; and, holding it to the lamp-
light, he showed it to him, saying: Tllz's will πο more injure llzee‘.

ες Saying this, he threw it away, and disappeared, with his light, from
before the eyes of the amazed man; but a most refrcshing fragrance
remained in the house throughout the night. When, therefore, he
had been restored to health, no one was present before him at the
nocturnal vigils. All were amazed that he, whom they expected

30 to find dead by now, was still alive, ancl they began to question
him how he had been healed. He told them that he had been
visited by St. Paul, and related what the latter had said to him :
how also he had extracted from his side the broken and putricl rib,
and “Here it is,'’ said he, lifting it from the ground; and he

35 showed it to them all. They all wonder at the deed‚ and all
together, to the sound of cymbals, give praises to the Lord.

36 But let us now return to the order of the narrative. XVhen,
after the death of the Duke Geoffrey, Felix desired to return to
his own monastery, the Duchess Havoise would not let him go,

40 but begged him, with many entreaties, to stay and finish the works
which her husband had begun to do in the restoration of the
convents. Being thus detained by the Duchess and her
