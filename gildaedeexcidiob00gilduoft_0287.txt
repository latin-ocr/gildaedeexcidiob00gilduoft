characteristic modifications and enlargementS, is based upon that
of Finnian. I'do not now touch upon the question of the non-
genuineness of certain parts of the Penitential in the form
preserved to us, but refer to the fact that we have certainly, in a
large Section of it, a code of rules closely connected with the Irish
Penitential of Finnian, and the Welsh Penitential of Gildas.

In the same line with these we find a fourth, which bears the
name of Cummean, or Commean, or Kumin. This penitentiale
Cummeanz· contains materials that have a British, Irish, English and
Frankish origin; for instance, the first four rules of the Eritish
Penitential printed below, appear there, and in the same order
(Cumm. Penii„ ii, 23-26) ; but what impresses one still more is, that
rule 14 below (which is shown to be probably a quotation from
some early source, by its use of tamen), is found also in the middle of
the Preface attached to the Penitential of Cummean (vide Notes).

Who this Cummean was, is not known, though the influence
of his collection appears to have spread over a very large area.
Of many so-called, the best known is one that was Abbot of
Iona from 657 to 665, who is also the author of the oldest Life
of Columba. Another of the name, styled bishop, is found at
Bobbio (an Irish monastery at the soot of the ApennineS, founded
by Columbanus in 612), about the first half of the eighth century,
during the reign of the Longobard King Luitprand. Wasserschle-
ben is inclined to regard the latter as the author of the Penitential
that was so very extensively used on the continent.l

In the English Church a collection of rules, that is a Penitential,
is attributed to Archbishop Theodore, and called the Penitential
of Theodore. The influence of this book seems to have been very
wide, but it contains many traces of the three first named. Another
Penitential is ascribed to the historian Beda, while a third bears
the name of Egbert, Archbishop of York. Theodore died A.D. 690,
Beda 735, Egbert 767. While the question of authorship, or of
the genuineness of certain portions, need not be discussed here,
there can be no doubt as to the extensive use of these books in the
English and other Churches One of doubtful authenticity has not
been named; it is found with the title lee Book ofDavid (Liber
Davz'dz's), and is ascribed to David of Menevia, or, as better known,
Dewi Sant: others have, as well, been left unmentioned.

quoted on s. 64, speaks of him as Cumiamcs episcopus. Mone regards
Columba himself as the author, Cummean or Kumin having written the
Preface.
