Good and conclusive reasons are given for regarding this
Luxemburg Fragment as having formerly belonged to Echternach,
a monastery founded by Willibrord, the Apostle of the Netherlands
(† 738), in the eighth century,l whither it may, very probably, have
come from Fleury, in Brittany. But the glosses have been tran-
scribed in the MS. by a scribe who did not understand the Celtic
tongue in which they were written at· the first; yet one might
reasonably conclude that the original writer of the barbarous Latin
and the glossator would be one and the same writer, a man of
Britain (or of Brittany ?).

When we consider the marked characteristics of these docu-
ments, the area for comparison widens ; they consist of a number
of words and phrases noticeable for their persistent frequency.
The Latin throughout presentS, in exaggerated form, that affected
rhetorical pompous style which seems to have flourished in the
sixth century, thrusting itself, as Le Blanc observes, even into
monumental inscriptions of the time in Gaul, but particularly
observable in British and Irish writings. The Hzlrperz'ca Famina
seems to be a kind of Latin school-book for use in a monastery3
a few short quotations will show its character, and introduce also
some of the words to which allusion has been made. These I have
italicised 3 see also the previous extracts :—

“ Non ausonica me subligat catena?
Ob hoc scottigenum haud cripitundo eulogium.”

“ Does not the Ausonian chain bind me?
Wheresore Ι give no jarring sound in Irish speech.'’

The first line, thus punctuated, means: “ Don’t Ι speak good

Latin ? ”

“ Farriosas sennosis motibus corrosimus crustellas,
quibus lita scottigeni pululavit conditura olei.’'

“ We gnawed the mealy cakes with the motions of our teeth,
from which flowed the o⁷erspread sauce of lrish fat.''
