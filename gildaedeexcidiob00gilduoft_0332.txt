320 Vita l.

island is widened in answer to the, prayer of Illtud, and the
prayer is recorded in full; yet the two give a totally different
prayer, with hardly a single idea or supplication in common.
According to one, Paul becomes bishop of Oxismori, while the
other, with full details, makes him bishop of Leon. In recording
the bell incident, the circumstances and periods differ3 besides
that, the one calls it clem, the other tz'ntimmbulmlz. As a further
small detail, we may add that the master's name appears in the
Life of Gz'ldas as Heldutus‚ in the Life of Paul as lldutuS. lt
seems difficult not to regard writers who are authors of two
works that present such divergencies as these, as starting from
a meagre common source. Nevertheless‚ the conviction remains,
that the sze of Gz'ldas belongs to the same monastic literary circle
as the other tw0, ancl, probably to about the same period. In
that case, we have before us a production of the ninth century,
based, as those, upon older recordS‚ which therefore reproduces
older traditions (or guesses) than are to be found in the next Vita
by Caradoc. These traditions are really welsh in origin.

Not only does this Vita not stand by itself, but the Breton
group to which it belongs should be remembered as possessing
certain features in common, which differentiate the Vitae forming
the group from all those that were written in wales. In the British
Vitae, such as our Vita ll of GildaS, and the Vim David, it is
extraordinary that Illtud does not appear as the abbot-teacher of
these men, his very existence seems forgotten. And the same may
in part be said of other important Vitae printed by Renes, such as
the Vita Cad0c2·; in none of them is Illtud the great teacher ochlsh
saints. If we examine again the Vitae contained in the Book (gf
Llandcfv, we find that the Vita Samsom's is an abridged form of
the earlier Breton Life printed by Father Plaine in the Analecta
Bollandmna, and by M. Ch. Cuissard in the Revela Cellique; the
Visa Dubricii seems a patchwork‚ the latter part of which is
borrowed from the Life of Samsen; the Lzse of Tcz'lo is clearly a
sermon, as the repeated karissimifratr& shows. But, throughout,
Illtud has not the position which wc have been led to connect with
his name; a detached paragraph on p. 71 makes him a disciple of
Dubricius‚ who sends him “as abbot to the place (pedum), which
from him is called Lannildut''; he is, however, not a teacher.

I have not referred to the Vita lllutz'Abbatis in Rees' volume
(p. 158) ; but in that work, although we meet with the four scholars
pre-eminent over all the rest, yet the whole setting is comparatively
modern, as may be seen especially from c. 12, and tlte tem-hers
