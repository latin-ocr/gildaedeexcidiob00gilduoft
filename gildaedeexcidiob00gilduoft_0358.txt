1 Letavia. The writer expressly informs us that this was a name employed
by the Britanni, i.e.‚ the Bretons, themselves. Generally speaking, the only
name we find in Latin writers, from Gregory of Tours down to the Middle Ages,
is Britannia, sometimes with the adjective minor added, to imply the smaller
Britain as distinguished from the island Britannia. Gregory has both the
singular Britannia and the plural Britanniae, while the people in his pages
are everywhere called Britanni, though once, seemingly, we read of a quidam
Britto. Other writers employ the form Brittones, as for instance, Samson is
made to say to King Hilbertus : ‘⁴ Ι have come into the country ofthe Brittones’'
—in Brittonnm patriani deveni. These names, whatever date be given to the
emigration or emigrations to Armorica, must have been carried over by the
people themselveS, and many other old names found new places to desig-
nate, such as Dumnonia (Devon), Cornubia (Cornwall), Leon, etc. Of such
names of places or peoples conveyed to Armorica, Letavia is an instance.

In the Vita S. lllnti the form is also Letavia (c. i) ; but the Vita cadoci twice
gives us the name as Lettan (cc. 32, 42). Nennius (Historia Brittonum, c. 27)
is probably the earliest writer to mention Brittany under this name ; or, to speak
more correctly‚ two MSS. of his work, which insert an interpolation of con-
siderable length. After the record that the Britons who had left Britain with
Maximianus (Maximus, more correctly) for the continent, never returned, but
became the “ Britons of Armorica'' (Brittones Armorici), the interpolation pro-
ceeds to say that, having married Gallic wives, they cut the tongues of all, lest
the children should learn their mothers' language. “ For which reason those are
called in our tongue Letewicion, that is, half-muteS,because they speak confusedly
<id est, semi-tacentes quoniam confuse loquuntur).’' The derivation so given
to Lamia-ion is from let <=modern lltd) in the sense of “ partly’‘ ; and
lcwicion (tewi, tewzgion), “ silent ones ”z Lelewic, however, is Lelantus,
meaning an inhabitant of Letau or Letczw, which in modern Welsh is Llydaw.
llenry of Huntingdon (i, 43) repeats the assertion of Ncnnius as to the settle-
ment of Dritons in Armorica in the time of Maximus: “Brittones vero quos
Maximus secum adduxerat in Gallia Armorica usque hodie remanse1·unt.'’

when hc places the coming of Gildas to Letavia in the time of this prince.
