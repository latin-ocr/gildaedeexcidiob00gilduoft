398 Vita Gz'ldae.

reges timebant timendum, cui obediebant audita acceptabili sua
praedictione. Praedicabat omni dominica apud maritimam eccle-
siam, quae stat in Pepidiauc regione,1 in tempore Trifini regis‘2;
innumerabili multitudine plebis illurn audiente, et dum inciperet
praedicare, retenta est vox praedicationis in praedicante, unde 5
plebs ammirata est valde pro admirabili retentione. Sanctus
Gildas illud comperiens praecipit omnibus astantibus exire, ut

 

The Saron Chronz'cle speaks of persons going “with ships from Bristol about
Brytland’' in 1063; also of “going to Hirland and to Brytland . . . . and so
to Hereford,” in 1055 ; still, there are not wanting instances where Britain must
include England. We gather that Britannia continued long as a name for that
part of the island, whatever its extent, that was inhabited by its old Celtic
people, but particularly by the &Velsln yet that writers of the twelfth century
were in the habit also of extending its compass so as to include the English
portion of the island as well. Britanni seems to have prevailed much longer as

a name exclusively for the Welsh people, and so also the adjective Britannicus
in reference to thern.

At the time when Caradoc wrote, South Wales, and himself, probably, were
under Norman influence, and accordingly he employs the name Walh'a (c. 9)
for &Vales, and lisalezzses (c. 8) for its inhabitants (cc. 7, S) 3 maior Britannia
is twice used in the well-known meaning of contrast, as well as Britannia in the
older sense. One is almost driven to conclude that tria regna Britannia must
refer to XVales, England and Scotland, just as Geoffrey's main divisions of
Britain are Cambria, Loegria, and Albania. Still, Caradoc was a reader of
Gildas' De Excidio, from which fact it would appear impossible for him to speak
of Gildas' popularity as a preacher reaching to parts held by the “ Saxons, hated
of God and man.'' His words may imply the influence of Gildas' last days at
Glastonbury, related by himself in this Vita, as exerted among the English ;
but William of Malmesbury quotes a charter of the year 601, which proves that
Glastonbury at that time belonged to a British king (Gesta Reg. Angl„ c. 27).
Neither is Gildas’ mission to the North, recorded in Vita l, mentioned by
Caradoc. A possible solution suggests itself to my mind, if we regard tria
regna Britanniae as a petrified phrase, which, in its time of life, had a definite
and intelligible meaning. In the so-called Gwentian Brut, printed in the
Alyvyrian Arclzaz'ology (p. 688, :znd edit., vol. ii, p. 468 of rst edit.), and in the
Historz'e of Powel (p. 29) Rhodri Mawr is said to have divided W'ales into three
divisions, “which they called kingdoms, which remained untill of late daies.
These three were Gwynedh, in English, North W’ales ; Deheubarth, in English,
South &Vales ; and Powysland ” (Sir John Price, Descrz'ption of lVales). That
these three territories were called ‘⁴ kingdoms” (regna) is probable, since the
princes themselves are called reges in the Annales Cambriae, ag„ 909 Catell rex
moritur ; 91 5 A narrati rex moritur ; Merfyn is 2=ller11zz'tzlts rex, in N ennius, c. 16;
also, in the earliest Bruty Tywysogion they are named, “brenhinoedd'’ (kings).
‘Ac yna y duc y Saeson vrenltinyaetlz Powys ;’' “ bu varw Anarawt vab Rodri

159, 100. Now, side by side with this tradition we place the fact that &Vales is
