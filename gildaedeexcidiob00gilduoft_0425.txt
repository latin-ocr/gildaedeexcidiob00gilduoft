The L²f⁶³ Of Gildas. 413

Latin, and gutrin is vitrea (made of glass). But after the coming
of the English and the expulsion of the Brstons, that is, the Welsh‚
it received a fresh name, Glastigberi, according to the formation of
the first name, that is, English glan, Latin vitrum, and beria a city;
then Glastiberia, that is, the City of Glass

Caradoc of Nancarban's are the words ;

Who reads, may he correct ; so wills the author.

 

 

A third Vita is extant in the Paris Codex 5318 (ff. 163-166)‚
and has been published in full, in the Casaloglts Hagz‘ograpln‘cormu
Latinorum, Tom. ii, edited by the Hagiograpllz' Bollandz‘am'. Ι
have read this through carefully‚ and must conclude that it is a
recension of our Vim l, adapted to another locality and to other
personages, It is called Visa Sancti Gildasz'z‘ cmgfessorz‘s alque
abbatis, quae celebratur 2‘2‘2‘2' kalendas Februarii. Gildas, or Gildasius,
is brought to beatus Fz'lz'berlus T ornodensz'mn abbati, that is, “ to St.
Phylebert‚ who was then abbot of Tournay,'’ as we find in the old
French adaptation of the Vita described by Petrie (Descriptz've
Catalogue, No. 441). Nearly throughout, the very order and words
of Vita lare used, but all names are suppressed, except Trisina,
which is given as Trzfima,· we have, for instance : ‘¹ Erat igitur in
illis diebus quidam tyrannus,’' but the name Conomerus is omitted
(cf. Vita l, c. 20) ; so again, “ misit ad quendam principem’‘ (ibid),
but here also with the omission of his name, Werocus. The
document has evidently nothing to do with Gildas, except as a
disguised reproduction of our first Vita.
