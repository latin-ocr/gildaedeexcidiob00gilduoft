me in the priesthood. After a few words : thy didst thou loole upon 1 Sam. ii, 29.
my incense and my sacrifice with an evil eye, and didst honour
thy sons more than me, so as to bless them from the beginning in
all the sacrifices before me Ρ And now thus saith the Lord : Ι Sam. ii, 30.
5 Because them that honour me will l honour, and they that despise 31'
me shall be brought to nought, behold the days shall come that l
shall destroy thy name and the seed (ff thy father's house. A nd let Ι Sam. ii, 34.
this be a sign unto thee, which shall come upon thy two sons Hophni
and Phineas: in one day shall they both die by the sword of nien. If
10 therefore they who merely correct those subject to them by words,
and not by deserved punishment, suffer these things, what shall
be to those who incite and draw men to wicked deeds by sinning?
77 What happened also to that true prophet, after the fulfilment
of the sign foretold by himself and the restoration of the withered
15 hand to the impious king, when he was sent to prophesy in Bethel,
and was forbidden to take any food there, but was deceived by
another prophet, as he was called, to take a little bread and water,
is evident. His host says to him : Thus saith the Lord God, I Kings xiii,
Forasmuch as thou wert disobedient to the mouth of the Lord and 21’24'
20 hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded,
and camest bach and hast eaten bread and drunk water in this place
in which l had commanded thee not to eat bread nor to drinh water,
thy body shall not be placed in the sepulchre of thy fathers. And it
came to pass, it is said, after he had eaten bread and had drunh
25 water, that he saddled his ass for him and he departed. And a lion
78 found him in the way and slew him. Hear also the holy prophet
Isaiah, speaking of the priests in the following manner : W'oe unto lsaialz iii, 11-
the wichedfor evil ! for the reward of his hands shall be unto him. ¹5·
Their overseers have spoiled my people and women have ruled over
30 them. O J my people, they who call thee blessed, themselves deceive
thee and destroy the way of thy paths. The Lord standeth to juassge
and standeth to judge the peoples. The Lord will come to judgment
with the elders of his people and the princes thereos. Y e have eaten
up my vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your house. thy crnsh
35 ye my people and grind the face os the poor P saith the Lord os hosts.
Again ε W oe unto them that dccree unrzghteous laws (ind as ieri’i'ters lsaialz x. 1-3.
have written unrzghteousness, to oppress the noodr in jndgment and
malee violence to the cause os the poor of my people, that widows may
be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless. W hat will ye

40 do in the day ofvisitation and of the calamity that cometh from afar P
