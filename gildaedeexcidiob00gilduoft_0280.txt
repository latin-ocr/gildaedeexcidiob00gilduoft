tion, yielding its place to communio. Hartel's Index shows how it, and not
communio, is the common word in Cyprian's writings for Christian fellowship
or communion. It may be that Augustine is also unconsciously using the old
African word in Confess., v, 2: et sic communicatio Dominici corporis illic
celebraretur. See Koffmanne, Gesclz. des K irchenlaleins, 7 3.

¹ These words do not appear in the Cambridge MS. ; they are taken from

Hibern., xxxvii, 5, under the heading, “ Princes are not to be censured upon a
trivial charge.''

2 This extract from Hibern„ lii, 6, seems exceedingly doubtful as assigned
to Gildas: the first four words may be his, but the remainder will be best

regarded as a gloss added by the compiler of the Irish collection, at a time
when the Church of Ireland had adopted Roman customs‚ while the British
churches still held aloof.

In the first four words of X. we hear an echo of the opening chapters of the
De Excidio ‚· the remainder repeats assertions made during the Conference at
Whitby‚ when North Britain was won over by the influence of Wilfrid to the
adoption of Roman usages3 it repeats also the main argument advanced by
Aldhelm of Malmesbury, in the letter which he wrote to the king and bishops
of Damnonia, by the direction of the Council of Hatfield. Wilfrid, in that
Conference of 664, maintains that Picts and Britons “fight with foolish toil
against the whole world;'’ that they derive their custom (in this case their
obscrvance of Easter) from a time “when the Church was judaizing in many
things ⁷² (Beda, H. E., iii, 25 ; Aldhelm's letter, lllon. Germaniae Hz‘st., Epp„ iii,
231-233).

Although the extract cannot be regarded as conveying to us any words of
(fildas, it has, nerertheless, a real interest as a summary of points in which the
Church of Britain was “contrary to the whole world.'' From Beda's Hz'stmy
and Aldhelm's letter we gather that the Britons were particularly regarded as
stiff-necked‚ because of their unwillingness to change in three or four usages.
These were, the time of the celebration of Easter, the tonsure, and their mode
of administering the rites os baptism ; a fourth is introduced in this Exti-act
which may well have been included in the “alia plurima unitati ecclesiasticae
contraria,” mentioned by Beda (H. E., ii, 2). This is the British Lsturgy, or
illisi-a. Compliance with Roman customs brings to the Irish Church this new
conviction, that the Churclies of Eritain were schismatic; “the precepts os your
