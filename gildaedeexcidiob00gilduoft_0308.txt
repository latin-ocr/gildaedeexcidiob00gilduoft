296 Appendix C.

definiteness exhibited in this Hymn, nor do we find it in the
&Vestem Church until the writings of Gregory the Great became
the leading and guiding books of early mediaeval times. It may
be that Gregory, in these matters, was acccpting what had already
become a pious and popular belief; still, it is in his writings that
we first know in Latin of the nine orders of angels‚ that is to say,
angels‚ archangels, powers, potencies, principalities, dominions,
thrones, cherubim and seraphim. If his Homz‘lies belong to c. 600,
could the Lorz'ca, with its grades of angeIS, archangels, powers, etc.‚
have been written about 540? Ought it not rather be brought
down to the time of Laidcenn‚ that is, to about 660? Let us put
this difficulty aside for a while.

The Lorica of Gildas was cmnposed, as wc see from vv. 5, 6,
during a year of pestilence which had many victims (mortalitas
lucius (mni). If we accept the tradition that ascribes the author-
ship of the Hymn to Gildas himself, or, as Zimmer frequently
expresses it, to “die sudwestbrittanische Litteratursphare,'' we may
fix upon 540-550 as an approximate date. In 547, according to the
Annales Cambriaest there was a great mortality, in which Maelgwn,
king of Gwyncdd, died; of this plague the Life of Teilo, in the
Book of Llandas? gives a somewhat lengthy account, mentioning
also the death of Maelgwn, It is about the same time, though
Dr. Stokes does not venture to append a date, that the Irish
Annals of ngrernaclss record “a great mortality which is called
‘blefed'’'; and in the Annals of Ulster4 we have the notice
under A.D. 544: “The first mortality (mortalitas prima) which is
called ‘blefed‚' in which Mohi Clarainech died ;’' the Clzrom'con
Scotorum affixes the date 541. It seems safe, therefore, to conclude
that a dreadful plague raged over these islands during one or more
of the years between 540 and 550, at which time this Hymn may
have been composed by Gildas.

There is no record ofany other pestilence in theAnnales Cambm'ae
until 682, “in which Cadwaladr the son of Cadwallawn died.”
In Ireland, however, the Anmzls make frequent mention of a great
mortality which began “on the Kalends of August,'’ the year
