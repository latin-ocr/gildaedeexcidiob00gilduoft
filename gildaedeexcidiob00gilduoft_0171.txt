“ Auffallend ist es '’—these are his own words—“dass die Sammlung nur sehr
5113111611 Bestimungen aufgenommen hat, welche die Kirchliche Versassung und
die Gliederung der Organe fiir die Kirchliche Jurisdiktion regeln. Die
Organisation der Kirche in Dio’zesen und Provinzen, 1135 Verhiiltniss der
Bischo'fe, als Leiter der erzteren, ze den Erzbischoben, als Haupten der

(2) The second expression, celeri sacerdotes, implies, as in fact the whole
language of this part implies, the same idea as prevailed elsewhere by that
time, that the ministry of the Church is a priestly one. In the first rank, and
unless otherwiselimited, it is the bishops that are llze priests, but the name
sacerdotes 15 3150 applied to presbyters : the chair of both presbyter and bishop
is a priest⁷s chair (post sacerdotalem episcopatus vel presbyterii sedem, c. 66).
(3111135 1135 1101 yet, nor the usage of 1115 111116, arrived 31 1116 terminology found
in Wasserschleben’s Irish Canons, viz., episcopus, sacerdos, diaconus. It is not
quite out of place to remind ourselves 11131 1116 31111116311011 of the term “ priest '³
(smerdes) to presbyters was not usual before the end of the fourth century. For

Tertullian and Cyprian, the sacerdos 15 1116 11151101) only. Koffmane mentions
one instance (Ep. 67, 4) in the writings of Cyprian, where sacerdos may be taken
as another term for presbyteras 3 but it does not, I feel on reading the whole
context, seem to bear out his statement. Ritschl maintains that the priesthood
of presbyters is implied in 3 few passages (Epp, 61, 3 3 72, 2 ; 5, 2), yet his view
has been disputed (Studia Biblica, vol. iv, 258).‘¹'

This early limitation of the term “priest,'⁷ prevails in Gildas 10 1116 extent
that his reference to presbyters is quite secondary; there could hardly be, at
his time, any presbyters in sole charge of 3 61101611 ; altari et sacrificiis
deserviunt, to use words of Cyprian in regard to them, in the same church as
the bishop, or in churches under his immediate 1161501131 supervision. They
were, however, regarded 35 priests in Britain 3 and conformably with this idea
of their and the bishop's office, we not only find frequent use of such terms as
“altars ²² and ιι5361111665,υ by Gildas, in allusion to the Eucharist, but 3150
“offering f0r,'' or “making sacrifice sot-⁷³: pro bonis regibus, he says, sacra
debemus 0ffi⁷rre (De Poma, xxiii). The doctrine of the Eucharist and the
ministry of the Church, which Britain knew, is evidently the same, let us say, as
that of the Roman bishop, who lived not long after Gildas, Gregory the
Great (590—604); or, in other words, it is that which, by a natural develop-
ment, grew 10 116 1116 media-:val doctrine.

 

ἦ One fact suggested by the work to which reference has been made—-
Cypmkm von Karllzczga und dfe Vetjfizssmlg der Kirche—-seems to 113ν6 3 116601131
cogcncy for us: while the noun is silem-dos, the verb 15 generally offi’re, 31111
though the noun may not be applied to presbyters, the verb z's used of them:
they are said “to offer'' (offiv‘unl). Now, in the Welsh language, the sub-
stantive sacerdos seems to have left no derivative, as in the Irish 31111 (336116
languages, but the verb has remained in offiiriad(priest) and off‘eren (mass,
offerenda).
