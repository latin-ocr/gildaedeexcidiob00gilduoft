Opto tronos,1 virtutes, archangelos,
principatus, potestates, angeIOS‚
ut m(e) denso defendentes agmine
inimicos valent2 prosternere.
Dum deinde ceteros agonetetas3
patriarchas quatuor, quater profetas,
apostolos navis Christi proretas?
et martires omnes peto athletas,5
atque adiuro et virgines omneS,
viduas fideles et confessores,
Uti me per illos salus sepiat,
atque omne malum a me pereat.
Christus mecum pactum firmum feriat
cuius tremor tetras turbas terreat.

et martirum curn Christo.

Incipit prologus secundus de cunctis membris corporis usque ad genua.⁷]

Deus inpenetrabilis tutela
undique me defende potentia ;

¹ T renos, virtutes, K reads thronos: t and tlz had the same sound. K and
the other MSS. read viventes for virtutes: this, however, reduces the names of
grades by one. A strange (Celtic ἲ) accusative appears in the Leyden Lorica
(p. 294), in supplicatory clauses.

² Valent : the metre requires valeant.

³ A gonelelas = agonffthelas (ἀγωνοθέτας) ; deinde is probably of three
syllables (see v, 57) ; then this last word has one syllable in excess. The other
MSS. have agonz'tlzetas.

⁴ Proretas for πρῳράτας, the men on the look-out on board a ship : the ship
being the church here. An A.-Saxon gloss gives ancor-man.

⁵ Athletas (for ἀθλὴτας). Zimmer regards antlzletas as the original : it is so
found in the Luxernb. Fragment (fol. 1 r, 15) ; c and N have that reading here ; Κ
has anathlelas, which is confirmatory. Gregory of Tours has accensus, succensus
sor accessus, successus, thensauri for thesauri.

⁶ These lines are suspicious for reasons mentioned above (p. 295).

⁷ Dr. de Gray Birch gives two interesting specimens of prayers, by way of
illustrating the practice of praying for protection for the several parts of the
body (Boole osNunnaminsler, p. 25). But the closest parallel is found in the
Lorz'ca of Leyden printed above, both as to the elaborate enumeration of
parts, and the grammatical forms of names sor those parts.

³ Mee gibre. Here, within the compass of eight lines, we have a number os
