T he Life of Gildas. 337

against the temptations of the devii, and tortured himself in resist-
ing the pleasures of the body, what else can be said of him except
that he underwent a tedious martyrdom? For he himself was
both his own persecutor, and the patient sufferes who endured the

5 persecutions which he brought upon himself.

8 When, therefore, he had been promoted to holy orders and
was discharging the duties of a presbyter, he heard that the people
who inhabited the northern region of the island of Britain were
still held back by pagan error, and that even those who were

10 deemed Christians among them were not orthodox, but were
ensnared by the various impositions of heretics He therefore
took up, according to the apostle's instruction, the armour os God,
that lze nnglct be able to witlestand in [lle evil day, and, lzavz'ng
been perfectea' in all things, to stand ‚· and then, he began, trusting

15 in Christ's help, to proceed thither. And so, standing, having
girdea' tlze loz'ns of llis mind among the pagans and heretics, leaving

the demoniacs were enred, the lepers were cleansed, and all the sick
were healed. St. Gildas, therefore, continued in the preaching os the
Gospel of Christ, teaching the true saith through all the provinceS,
and converted his nation to the true and catholic saith.

9 While St. Gildas was doing these and similar things, all the
nation of the northern region began to flock, from every quarter‚
to the doctrine which he preached ; with the result that, after for-
