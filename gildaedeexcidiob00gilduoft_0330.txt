318 Vita l.

884, the third, c. 870, an older Life, simpler and briefer, in each
case serving as 3 basis. The Life of Gz‘ldas bears a very close
resemblance to that 01 Paul of Leon ; and if a suggestion, inciden-
tally thrown out by Mommsen, to the effect that the two Vitae are
01 1110 same origin, be accepted, we may also conclude that the
date 1008, mentioned in e. 34, is too late. In fact, the whole of this
part, from c. 33 to the end, has every appearance of being a later
addition.

The Vita edited by 3 130500 was reprinted by the Bollandists in

Aa. Ss. 29 san. Il, 958—967, and by Colgan in Aa. Ss. Hiberniae
l. Lovanii, 1645, p. 181.

Mabillon again published the Vita in A a. Ss. O. S. Bm. mee. J,
1668, p. 138-152, in a fuller form, that is, with the addition of
cc. 13-17.

XVhen we compare the Life proper, which seems complete at
the end 01 c. 32, with the Life cffPaul, it is evident that they are
both of Breton origin. In each we find quite a number of Welsh
or Breton names, explained in the same manner by Latin equiva-
lents. For instance, in this Life of Gillias, we have Coetlann with
the explanation monasterirum nemoris, “the monastery of the
wood''; 50 Εφυεείῇ] (Cives-dy) is domus sanctae emmim and
loclzmeuecli or locmeneclz means locus monachorum, which we have
in modern 11701511 35 mynaclzlog (logz locus). In the Life of Paul his
birthplace 15 said to be Penn Ollen (Peri Velien), which 15 explained
as Caput anm, and when it 15 said 01 him that he came to a
“place which in their language now 15 called Caer Banlzed? the
biographer, by way 01 explanation, adds villa Banbodm, while
Latina Pauli (the [lan of Paul) is interpreted to mean nmnasteriam
Pauli. The two Lives, as well as the Life of Samson, represent
the monastery of which Illtud was abbot, 35 being situated on a
small island (insulula and insula), the Vita Pauli more minutely
describing it as on the borders 01 Dyfed, and called Pyrus (crat autem
quaedam insula Pyrus nomine Demeliarum pall-iae in finibus sita).¹
To the biographer 01 Samson, Pyrus is a man who had lately
founded a monastery, or, as he puts it, an “ island’' (insula quaedam
mtpel‘fundala); but, putting aside these and other discrepancies,
we find that the island, at the time when two 01 1110 Lz'ves were
written, was called Lanna lldnti (Llanilltud or IAanelltud), or as
