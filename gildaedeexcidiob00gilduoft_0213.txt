also speaks: Thus saith the Lord unto this people‚ that loved to ser. xiv, 10.
move its feet, and hath not rested, and hath not pleased the Lord.
Now will we remember its iniqnities and visit its sins. The pro- Jer. xiv, 13-17·
phets say nnto them, Ye shall not see the sword, and famine shall
5 not be among you, but the Lord will give yon true peace in that place.
And the Lord said anto me, The prophets prophesy salsely in my
name: J sent them not, and have not commanded them: they pro-
phesy nnto a lying vision, and divination and fraud, and the deceit os
their own heart. Therefore, thns saith the Lord‚ By sword and
10 famine shall those prophets be consnmed, and the people to whom they
have prophesied shall be east ont in the streets of jerusalem because
of the famine and the sword, and there shall be none to bury them.
82 Again : W‘oe unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep Jer- xxiii, 1, 2.
15 of my pastum, saith the Lord. T herffore, thus saith the Lord God
osIsrael to the pastors that seed my people‚ Y e have scattered my
floch and driven them away, and have not visited them ‚· behold I
will visit upon yon the evil osyonr inclinations, saith the Lord. For ser. xxiii, 11·
prophet and priest are pollntecl, and in my house have [found their 20'
20 wicleedness, saith the Lord. W herefore their way shall be as a
slippery 'place in darhness,sor they shall be driven on andfall therein,
for l will bring evils upon them, even the year of their visitation,
saith the Lord. And l have seen solly in the prophets of Samaria,
they both prophesied by Baal and deceivea' my people Israel. In the
25prophets of jerusalem also l have seen a similar thing, adnltery and
the way ofsalsehood, and they have strengthened the hands of evil-
doers so that no one returned from his wieleedness ,· they are all become
unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereos as Gomorrah. There-
fore, thus saith the Lord anto the prophets, Behold l will seed them
30 with wormwood, and mahe them drinh water os gall. For from
the prophets os Jerusalem is pollntion gone forth over all the land.
T hns saith the Lord of hosts, Hearhen not nnto the words of the
prophets that prophesy anto yon and deceive yon ,· they speah a vision
os their own heart, notsrom the mouth (ff the Lord. For they say
35 unto them that blaspheme me, The Lord hath said, Peaee shall be
nnto yon, and tinto eveyy one that walheth in the depr-aw'ty of his own
heart, they have said, No evil shall come upon yon. For who hath
been in the conneil of the Lord and hath seen and heard his word ‚P
Who hath marked his word and heard it Ρ Behold the whirlwind
40 of the Lord's fnry goeth forth, and a tempest burstz‘ng upon the head
of the wiched shall come. The anger of the Lord shall not return
until he have done, and until he have completed the intent os his
heart. In the last days ye shall understand his connsel.
