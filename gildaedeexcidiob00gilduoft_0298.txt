OTHER PENITENTIAL CANONS or WELSH ORIGIN.

XVasserschleben has also published three other, apparently Welsh, peni-
tential canons, from the very same MS. as contains the Penitential printed
above. The MS. had been previously used by the laborious and learned
Benedictine M artene sor vol. iv of his Thesaurus Novus Anecdotommz, which
was published in 1717 (Paris). Of this MS. a very full account is given by
Maassen: it is a strange mixture of extracts devoid of any order, containing,
with other material, extracts from Mosaic enactments, and excerpts from the
Pastor of Hermas and Scripture. Then follow the Irish Collection ofCanonS,
then the Penitential Canons, starting with an interesting collection belonging
to &Velsh National law, which may be found in Wrsserschleben, p. 125, in
Haddan and Stubbs' Cozmcz'ls, etc„ i, p. 126. The resemblance in general
features and in special enactments, found to subsist between these and the
Laws, of Hywel Dda, especially the Latin summary of Hywel's Laws, given on
p. 875 of Aneurin Owen's Ancz'enl Laws os Walcs, affords very convincing
proof that we have in them genuine pieces of Welsh legislation. There is,
however, hardly anything of a penitential character in them, on which account
there can be no further reference to them here. Without enumerating other
contents of this MS„ in its orderless excerpts from many writers and canons of
synods (spelt both senodus and sinodus), we come to the above Penitential of
Gildas; then follow Sz‘nodus Aquilonalz's Brz'lcmnioe, Allera Sinodus Luci
Victorioe, and Excerssta quaedam de Libro Davz'dz's. What follows need not be
named. But it may be mentioned that a controversy has arisen as to the origin
of these Celtic remains, the late Mr. Henry Braclshaw ascribing thern to
Brittany, whilst &Vasserschleben and Maassen regard them as lrish,¹ a question
that does not affect the object aimed at in the insertion of the three sets of
penitential canons in this place. They may, by being placed on this page,
serve to elucidate or illustrate some of the rules found above under the name
of Gildas.
