in femore suo scriptum: the Chronographer of A.D. 354 has: Odenatus vel
Aureolus in Italia ⁴tyranni fuerunt, 234, 14: the Anon. of Valesius: cunctus
senatus vel populus. These and many other instances are given in Ronsch‚
Colleclanecz philol„ pp. 51, 826 ; also Itala uml Vulgata, p. 345.

Three classes may thus be regarded as implied in these words. (1) The
bishops (episcopi), (2) the other priests, that is, the presbyters associated with
the bishops (celeri sacerdotes), (3) the clergy, bishops, presbyters or deacons that
had adopted the monastic life (clerici in nostro-—z‘e monachorum——ordz'72e).
The message of Gildas is directed first of all and mainly to bishops, then to
other clerics. He nowhere implies that there was any other function in the
Church important enough to be addressed by him ; this fact seems to dispose of
the attempt made to find, in Gildas' time, the ordo inusitatus described by
Beda as prevailing at Iona, and probably at Holy Island and other places,
where ecclesiastical jurisdiction was in the hands of Abbots (Η. Ε., iii, 4 ; iii, 5,
17, 25. Vita S. Cudh„ c. xvi). Cf. Reeves’ Adzznman, and Dr. Bright's Early
English Church Hz‘story‚ 135 ff.

The only monks included by Gildas in his message were clerics, and his
appeal is not directed to anyone holding any such monastic office as Abbot of
a monastery. But his bishops, further, cannot be “diocesan'' bishops; they
have theirparoclziae (c. 67), but are so numerous, good as well as bad, as to be,
in his opinion, in excess of the requirements of the Church; if not too many,
there were certainly, he says, not too few. W'e seem to find ourselves in Britain
face to face with the older kind of episcopacy which we meet with, for instance,
in Africa and Italy, about ΑΒ. 250, when the Bishop of Rome and the
Bishop of Carthage could bring together a council‚ the one of sixty, the other
ofninety bishops, By the fourth and fifth centuries, sees could be counteduby
hundreds in either of the countries named. The state of things in the later Church
of Ireland which astounded St. Bernard, when he wrote his Life oszlsalaclzias,
would seem to fit Britain in the time of Gildas, that it is say, there were almost
as many bishops as churches (ila ut singulae pene ecclesiae singulas haberent
episcopos—De Visa Mal„ c. 10). Many reminiscences of this “congregational
cpiscopacy,'' as it has been called, have filtered down into the Welsh hagio-
graphical writings. The Lz'Je (J Teilo represents him, as “of his own counsel‚
consecrating Ishmael sor the Church of Menevia, because Dewi had migrated
to the Lord ’³ ; but, “ many other men, also of the same order, did he raise to the
episcopate, sending them throughout the country, and distributing parochiae
to them, as was convenient for clergy and people.”

It is worthy of note that Gildas, with his heavy indictment of crimes against
the bishops, nowhere mentions any ecclesiastical authority, either of Synod or
of31e11·‹›p‹›1ita11, that might be expected to take disciplinary cognizance of the
irregularities involved in those misdeeds. &Vasserschleben has remarked, with
respect to the Irish Canons‚ which belong to a time later than Gildas, how
bare those canons are of any reference to organisation in Ireland, uniting
different communities and securing ecclesiastical jurisdiction : the relation of
bishops to Archbishops as Heads of Provinces is but barely mentioned in them.
