368 Vita Gz'ldae.

omnes amen, reddidit spiritum quarto kalendas Februariil senex et
plenus dierum. Discipuli vero illius tollentes corpus eius fecerunt,
sicut praeceperat eis Sed hi qui de Cornugallia2 venerant, qui
plures erant, conabantur eum tollere et in patriam suam transferre.
Dum ergo inter se colloquerentur et facere disponerent, nutu Dei 5
navis cum sancto corpore demersa est in profundum maris: illi
vero per multos dies illud huc illucque requirentes, cum nullo modo
invenire possent, ad propria sunt reversi.

Discipuli quoque eius qui ex Reuvisii coenobio erant, per tres 31
menses3 curn non possent et ipsi invenire eum, tandem consilio 10
accepto triduanum statuerunt ducere ieiunium. Quo peracto
cuidam ex eis revelatum est, quando et ubi inveniendus esset.
Igitur curn dies rogationum essent et ipsi orationis gratia ad
quoddam oratoriolum, quod ipse in honore sanctae crucis con-
struxerat, venissent, invenerunt navem in aestuario quod vocatur 15
Croest(i),⁴ id est domus sanctae crucis, curn sancto corpore integro et
illaeso, sicut ab ipsis collocatum fuerat in navi. Videntes autem
gaudio magno gavisi sunt et lapidem quidem super altare eiusdem

 

¹ Quarto kalendas Februarii. This day, the zoth of January, has been
generally accepted as the natalicium of Gildas. That he died on that day rests
upon the sole authority of this Vita3 but in a detail of this kind, the earlier
narrative upon which our biographer has,most probably, based his narrative,may
be regarded as having preserved a trustworthy fact. We find, on this account,
that in the Acta Sanctarum, the Lives of Gildas are assigned to this 29th of
January (ii, 958), while the year, according to the Annales Cambrz'ae, was A.D.
570. A very elaborate attempt to arrive at a more correct calculation will be
found in a pamphlet written by Mr. Alfred Anscombe, bearing the title,
St. Gila'as os lx’uys ami tlte [7¹2⁴ch lr'egal Chronalogy ofthe Sixz‘lz Cenlzcry (1893) 3
see first part, “The Obit of St. Gildas.'’ Mr. Anscomb concludes that we “may
date the discovery of the vessel containing the body of Gildas of Ruys, on
Rogation Monday, May 11th‚ AD. 554.'' The problem is a most difficult one,
and the data for determining it are meagre in the extreme z the steps which
lead to this conclusion as to the year 554 appear too precise for the scanty
details afsorded us by the records.

'-’ Hiqui de Cornugallia. This name must mean that partos Britanny which
was also called Cornuhia, peopled by the Cornovii of Cornwall, and is now
written Cornouailles in French. “There is,” we are told by M. de la Borderie,
‘'an extensive region in higher Cornouaillcs‚ forming a kind of triangle, in
which, under diverse forms, souvenirs of Gildas and his disciples abound.’'
The words quifilures erant, become in this light very significant, since no
particular monastery is mentioned ; many places in Cornouailles had, probably,
felt the influence of the monk preacher. Domnom'a lay to the west of it, Bro-
Weroch to the east, around Vannes.
