rogatus rexit utillimum, nulla mercede recepta a scolaribus
praeter orationes cleri et scolarium. Ubi ipsemet scripsit opus
quatuor euangehstamm,1 quod adhuc remanet in ecclesia sancti
Cadoci auro et argento undique coopertum ad honorem Dei et
scriptoris sanctissimi et euangeliorum. Tenent &Valenses indigenae 5
illud volumen pretiosissimum in coniurationibus suis nec audent
aperire ad videndum nec confirmant pacem et amicitiam inter
inimicos, nisi illud affuerit in primis appositum.

Finito anni spatio et scolaribus recedentibus a studio sanctus 9
abbas Cadocus et Gildas doctor optImus communi consilio adierunt 10
duas insulas, scilicet Ronech et Echin.2 Cadocus intravit proximi-
orem WValliae, Gildas adiacentem Angliae. Nolebant impediri in
ecclesiastico officio a confluentia hominum, propterea nesciebant
melius consilium quam relinquere Carbanam Vallem et adire
insulare secretum. Gildas fundavit in honore sanctae et individuae 15
Trinitatis oratorium et iuxta illud suum cubiculum; non in illo
tamen habebat suum lectum, sed sub alta rupe positum, ubi
iacebat usque mediam noctem vigilans et orans supra petram
omnipotentem Deum. Deinde adibat ecclesiam frigescens nimium,3
frigus erat ei dulce et tolerabile propter Deum. Pisciculos trahebat 20
a reti et ova a nidis volucrum, unde vivebat, quod sibi sufficiebat

 

 

culture, in times most deplorable, it suffices to know that during this century
(sixth), and the six following, they furnished, for the Church of France in
particular, a large number of learned bishops, and gave to the republic of
letters a cloud of celebrated writers⁷’ (Histoire Lz‘ttdraz're de la France). The
monastery became a school in Britain under Illtud, and continued to be so
with his disciples Dewi and Gildas. It seems that we have, in this passage,
the echo of a true tradition which joins the Abbot of Llangarfan with them in
the same work.

¹ Opus quatuor evargelistarzem. According to Vita sz‘oci, this work was
done in the island Echni ; “Cum beatus Gildas in Insula Echni Deo ministeriis
degeret, missalem librum scripsit . . . . ideoque codex ille Evangelium Gildae
vocatur³' (Rees' Cambro-Brilislz Saz‘nts, p. 66). From the present statement we
learn that there was, about 1150, at Llangarfan‚ a codex of the Four Gospels,
believed to have been written by Gildas. But we recall to mind such an example,
among others, as the Irish Ms. of the Gospels called the Boolc ofDurrow (Codex
Harma-hemis), on one page of which is an entry that St. Columba himself, who
died in 597, was the scribe ; yet the codex really belongs to the eighth century.
50, also, the famous Book osKells, another lrish codex of the Gospels, is in the
Ammls os Ulster called “the Great Gospel of Columcille⁷' 3 nevertheless
this also is known to be not earlier than the eighth century. W'e can conclude,
thus, no more froin this passage than that there was at Llangarfan a Welsh
Evasrgrelssl(zrium in Latin, and that it was reverenced by all as the actual work
