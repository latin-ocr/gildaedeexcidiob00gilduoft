was on this, which sufficed him for nourishment, that he lived.
The one used to visit the other. This mode of living lasted for the
space of seven years.
10 The supreme Creator, seeing that his chosen servant, Gildas,
5 had no constant supply of water beyond the drops of rain which
fell upon the stones and were caught as they trickled down, caused
a stream to flow out from a steep cliff—and it flowed out, and still
flows out, and will remain without exhaustion. While St. Gildas
was thus persevering, devoting himself to fastings and prayers,
10 pirates came from t'ne islands of the Orcades, who harassed him by
snatching off his servants from him when at their duties, and
carrying them to exile, along with spoils and all the furniture of their
dwelling. Being thereby exceedingly distressed, he could not
remain there any longer: he left the island, embarked on board a
15 small ship, and, in great grief, put in at Glastonia, at the time
when king Melvas was reigning in the summer country. He was
received with much welcome by the abbot of Glastonia, and taught
the brethren and the scattered people, sowing the precious seed of
the heavenly doctrine. It was there that he wrote the history of
20 the kings of Britain. Glastonia‚ that is, the glassy city, which
took its name from glass, is a city that had its name originally in
the British tongue. It was besieged by the tyrant Arthur with a
countless multitude on account of his wife Gwenhwyfar, whom the
aforesaid wicked king had violated and carried off, and brought

and marsh. The rebellious king had searched for the queen
throughout the course of one year, and at last heard that she
remained there. Thereupon he roused the armies of the whole of
30 Cornubia and Dibneria3 war was prepared between the enemies.
ΙΙ When he saw this, the abbot of Glastonia, attended by the
clergy and Gildas the Wise, stepped in between the contending
armies, and in a peaceable manner advised his king, MelvaS, to

 

William and Caradog, imagined, then perhaps believed, like things about
earlier times, so that it cannot be rash to pronounce what is related in these
chapters as pure fiction, we note also here, particularly, the unpleasant
jingle of Caradoc’s style : Susceptus vir suscz'pz'emlus; seminans semen
semz'namlmn ,⁴ visitabant saluti viri illum visilandzml.

Gildas could never have sent forth such a work as the De E.1‘c·2‘di0,l]e1·e
erroneously called Historiae de Regibus Britanniae, from the quiet retreat at
Glastonbury, after being driven there by the incursion of Northern pirates.
(See notes on c. 19 of Vita J.) Caradoc is dreaming.
