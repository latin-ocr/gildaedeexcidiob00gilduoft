consecration of priests that gives us about the earliest information respecting
that ritual in the Latin tongue.

4. With the fact that Gildas omits all reference whatever to the prayers used,
evidently feeling that the real weight of his appeal lay in the portions of Scrip-
ture quoted as read, we couple another. While prayers of prescribed form were
used in the ordination service, there seems to have been no authority for uni-
formity beyond custom(consuetudo) and the strong conservative spirit of Christian
communities, once a custom had begun its course. We find, also, that llze
smne consecratory prayer was employed for both presbyter and bishop‚ and that
3 very short one. We can hardly suppose that Gildas had before him the
words of such a consecrator-y prayer as that which begins: Deus honorum
omnium, Deus omnium dignitatum quae gloriae tuae sacris famulantur ordini-
bus ...... and proceeds: Comple, Domine, in sacerdotibus tuis mysterii
tui summam, et ornamentis totius glorificationis instructos caelestis unguenti
fluore sanctifica. Hoc, Domine, copiose in eorum caput influat, hoc in oris
subiecta decurrat, hoc in totius corporis extrema descendat, ut tui Spiritus
virtus et interiora horum repleat et exteriora circumtegat. Abundet in his
constantia fidei, puritas dilectionis, sinceritas pacis ....... Odiant super-
biam, diligant veritatem‚ nec eam unquam deserant aut lassitudine aut timore
superacti, etc.‚ etc. This prayer appears in the llffissale Francorum and the
Gelczsz'an Sacramentary, both Gallic books. It is a prayer from which we
should certainly have expected Gildas to quote rich appropriate words, strikingly
adapted for his purpose. Excellent reasons, however, are forthcoming for
regarding ·it as of Roman origin, and for the conclusion that the original Gallie
formulary had no such prayer in this part3 neither, presumably, had the British.
Let us notice the exact words of Gildas : “The benedictio, that is, the prayer by
wlziclz the hands of priests are consecrated;⁷' here there can be no intimation
of any prayer but that which accompanied the act of unction. Was no other
prayer used? If so, and if the prayer customary in Britain was, as it might
well be, similar to those found in the books named, then in no case does it
seem quite suitable for quotation. The following was the prayer which
accompanied the 1111011011 of the hands of deacons and presbyters :

May those hands be consecrated and sanctified by that unction and our blessing,

so that whatsoever things they bless may be blessed, and whatsoever things they
sanctify be sanctified.

When the hands of bishops were anointed, the following prayer was

ἰ( ζ

Sd l May those hands be anointed with holy oil and the chrism of sanctification, as
Samuel anointed David king and prophet ; may they be anointed and perfected in
the name of the Father, Son. and Holy Spirit‚ as we make the sign of the holy 01055

of the Saviour, our Lord Jesus Christ, Who redeemed us from death, and led us to
the kingdom of heaven. Hear us, merciful Father, almighty eternal God, and grant

115 that which we ask and pray for.

5. These offer no material for quotati0n3 hence Gildas' silence. The fre-
quent insistence on the part of Gildas in this work that ordination should be
received legitime, may lead to a short account of the rite as possibly con-
ducted in Britain during the sixth century. There can hardly be any doubt
that, at the time he wrote, the ordination of Gildas had already taken place;
so also had that of the other disciples of llltud, Dewi, Paul Aurelian, and
Samson. But when we turn to the Lz'ves of these men, we find nothing that
