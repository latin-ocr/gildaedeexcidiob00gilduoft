lee Life of Gz'ldas. 331

4 The afore—mentioned Hildutus dwelt with his disciples in a
certain island, narrow, confined, and squalid with its arid soil. One
day the blessed boy Gildas approaches him, and accosts him,
saying : “ My dear teacher, I heard you preaching lately frorn the

5 Gospel the words of our Saviour‚ in which he admonished his
disciples to ask of God in saith for the things which were beneficial
to them, and that they would receive the things thus prayed for in
saith, saying : Verily, l say unto yon, wlzatsoeverye asle for z'n prayer,
believe tlzatye will receive, and it shall be done nnto yon. Now,

10 therefore, my excellent master, why do you not ask our Lord
Jesus Christ, who is powerful to bestow all things which are asked
of Him in saith, that He extend the boundaries of this island, and
make its soil sruitful?'' When, therefore, St. Hildutus heard
these words, he wondered at the boy’s saith, and called his disciples

15 together, and entered with them into the oratory; and, bending
his knees to the ground and stretching out his hands to heaven,
he prayed, with tearful eyes, saying: Lord Jesus Christ, Thon
Son (ff Alnglzty God, wllo willa [lle Fatlzer and tlze Holy Ghost,
didst make lzeaven and earth, llze sea and all tlzat are tlzerez'n, and

20 wllo dz‘dst admonz‘slc tlzy dz‘sczples to pray anto (iod tlze Falller
for wllalsoever they needed, and llzat [lleir petilian would be
granted sltem ‚· yea, in ley name, we implore llze mercy of flze
Alnglzty Lord that, through Thee, He may command [lle bound-
aries of llzz's island to extend, and impat‘l fruitfitlness to its soil,

25 in order tlcat nnio ns, Τ lay servanls, and unta oar successam, it
may, through [lle bonntifnlness of ley grace, aſj‘ord foed in abnnd-
ance,· so tlzat satisfied by ΠΖ] gz‘fts, we may return tlzanks to ley
name, wlzo, willa [lle Fatlzer and tlte Holy Glmsl, livest and
rag-nest for ever and ever. When all had said Amen, and had

30 gone out from the oratory, they saw the island enlarged in all
directions, and blossoming round about with various flowers.
Then the aged man returns again to the oratory ; and, bathed for
joy in tears, he, along with the reverent flock ofhis disciples, chants
with a loud voice hymns and the highest praises to the Lord, the

35 Creator of all things, who 2'5 near nnto all tlzat call upon Hz'm

in trzc tle.

 

1 Amen dico vobis. The text in this quotation differs from the text of the
Vulgate; it is probably given from memory, as Amen dico vobis belongs
to the previous verse. The variation from the Vulgate is seen in the
words : Propterea dico vobis, omnia quaecumque orantes petitis . . . . cl vemt-f

vobis.
