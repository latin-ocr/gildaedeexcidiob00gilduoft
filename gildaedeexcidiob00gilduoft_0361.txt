sight of the district of Reuvisium, and there, for a considerable
time, spent a solitary life. But, after no long time, as the lamp Matt· v, ¹5·
that had been lit could no longer remain under a bushel, but
upon a stand, that all his neighbours and acquaintances, both near
5 and far away, might enjoy the light of its brightness, the people
began to flock to him from all directionS, and to entrust their sons
for their instruction to his superintendence and teaching. He
gladly took them all under his charge, and began to instruct them
in spiritual knowledge. Coming, therefore, to some fort on a
10 mountain in Reuvisium, situated in sight of the sea, he built there
a monastery of more skilful workmanship‚ and in it he constructed
defences after the fashion of cloisters. There his lise shone forth
so brilliantly that a large number of sick and maimed persons and
leperS, who were in the country round about, came to him, and
15 were restored to health by his actions and merits,-a wonder which,
even up to the present time, by the merits of the saint, Almighty
God has not ceased to work in that place.
17 He then, finally, built a small oratory on the bank of the river

 

. ; it is only six leagues in extent ..... The isle of Rhuys contains three
large parishes: in that of Sarzean, at the entrance, are situated the castle‚
forests, estates and park of Succinio, a convent of Mathurins, and the beautiful
priory of Hezean ; in the parish of St. Gildas, to the south, is the abbey of the
same name, and in that of Arzon, to the west, is an ancient convent of
Cordeliers.'' The famous Abelard, who was born not far from the neighbour-
hood, spent some part of his romantic life as abbot os this monastery ; one of
his letters to Heloise gives a graphic description of his treatment at the hands
of the monks over whom he had to preside. He must have followed soon after
the Felix mentioned below.

Reuvisium, or Reuvisius (in A Bosco's edition, Remnuisii and Rammysii), is
probably a compound, Reu— Visizcs, in which v of the second part would appear
as the semi-vowel w in a modern form; hence M. Loth is inclined to regard
Visizts or Uysius as the equivalent of the second part of Caer- Wys, if not also
of Portys (Pon-Vis). See L'Engrmtzbn Armorz'cainc, pp. 186, 187. Of the three
main tribes found among the Armorican settlers, the names Domnom'z' and
Domnonia, Cornovii and Cormcbz'cz, plainly show from what parts of Britain two
had come3 as to the original home of the third tribe, the people of Bro-XVaroch,
in the neighbourhood of Vannes, among whom Gildas settled, there are hardly
any names that give precise information (see note on c. 32).

The βαβαῖ of Reuvisium covered the small peninsula which forms the
southern border of the inner sea of Morbihan ; that sea and the “ile de Rhuys,''
or “presqu’ile de Rhuys,⁷² for both names are found, lie almost directly south
from Vannes. The present abbey stands on the edge of a high rocky promon-
tory called Grand Mont, facing the sea on the south, which, no doubt, is the
place mentioned by the writer as Affons Reuvisiz‘.
