of pearl, because fellow-labourers resisted them in a diocese,
and sternly refused them so profitable a business, they are
not so much grieved as delighted to send messengers before
them, to cross seas and travel over broad countries, so that in any
5 way such display and incomparable dignity, or to speak more
truly, such diabolical mockery, be acquired‚ even by the sale of all
their substance. Asterwards, with great state and magnificent
show, or rather foolery‚ they return to their own country, and show
their haughty gait more haughty. While hitherto their gaze was at
10 the tops of mountains‚ they now direct their half-sleepy eyes
straight to heaven, or to the light fleecy cloudS, and obtrude them-
selves upon their country as creatures of a new mould ; nay, rather
⁷ as instruments of the devil‚ just as aforetime Novatus at Rome, Rufinus sz- e.
the tormentor of the Lord's jewel, the black hog, their purpose V¹' 33'
15 is to stretch forth their hands violently upon the holy sacrifices of
Christ, hands worthy not so much of the venerable altars as of the
avenging flames of hell, because they are men placed in a position
of this kind.

presbyter Cypriani Romam veniens Novatianum et ceteros confessores sibi
sociat, eo quod Cornelius paenitentes apostatas recepisset. (Clzron. M. Germ.
H., s. 439.) Now Latin writers name Novatian as the leader of this separation,
and call the schism by his name, but Eusebius and other Greek writers ascribe
the movement to “the Roman presbyter Novatuss' Rufinus, in his Latin
version of Eusebius (H. E, vi, 43), repeats the mistake of the original : Novczfzcs
Romanae ecclesiae presbyter. We have good reason to infer that Gildas was
acquainted with Jerome⁷s works, the De viris illustribus in particular (which
work gives : Novatianus Romanae urbis presbyter); his present agreement with
Rufinus, therefore, leads us to infer that he is here borrowing from that writer's
Latin version of Eusebius.

⁵ Bestz'z‘s venlrz's. A. reads bestiis ventris pzjgri. This expression is certainly
borrowed from Titus i, 12, but must be from a text other than the Vulgate
of Jerome. We have thus another illustration of the way that Gildas, in avery
familiar quotation made off-hand from memory, falls into the Old Latin of his
early life (see Additional Note, p. 92). The passage, as we have it in the
Authorised Version, reads ε “ evil beasts‚ slow bellies ;’' which aptly renders the
Greek κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί, and the Latin malae bestiae, ventres pigri.
But Gildas seems to have read: malae bestiae ventris ngri=“ evil beasts of
idle belly.'' Now the Old Latin MS. g has this very reading, ventrisngrm, so
that oui· conjecture as to Gildas' usage seems to be well grounded. The next
quotation, from Jeremiah, appears to be of the same character, by its marked
deviation from the Vulgate, and that in a book which, when quoted at some
length, always agrees with that version.
