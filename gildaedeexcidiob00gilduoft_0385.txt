But, when Pasquetenus was captured by the Normans and then
redeemed, and afterwards treacherously murdered by sorneone,
Alanus alone, with his sons, as far as could be, reigned over that
5 province. At that time two monasteries—Lochmenech,that is, the
place (locus) of monks, and the monastery of St. Gildas—when their
occupants were routed, were abandoned and destroyed. Their
occupants were forced, in a body, to seek other districts, and to
set up new homes in the territory of the BiturigeS, carrying away
10 with them the bodies of the saints and nuns as relics which at
that time were revered amongst the Britons with festal devotion
and excessive feelings.
33 While the monastery of Moriacum, which is Locmenechffvas
presided over at that time by the abbot Taneth, Daiocus, an abbot
¹50f venerable life, was the head of the monastery of St. Gildas.
Under the altar of this holy church, in his own sepulchre, he buried
the remains of St. Gildas, that is, eight of his larger bones, which
have been discovered in our own time; but the monks carried
away with them the rest of them, together with the remains of St.
20 Paternus, the bishop of Vannes‚ and of other saints, along with their
books and ornaments vIn a similar manner the bodies of the
saints from the whole of Britanny were scattered through various
countries.
34 But when it seemed good to the Almighty Lord that the
23 churches of the saints in Britanny should be restored, and that the
British nation, which was in exile in a pitiable plight in foreign
countries, should return to its own homes, the Bretons regained
their strength. Both those who had remained in the country and
those who had been dispersed throughout the lands, gathered
30 together and took up arms, bravely fought their enemies, routed
them on land and sea, and drove thern out from all their territories.
At that time there lived in the city of Rennes a count, named
Iuchael, who was also called Bercngarius. This man had a son
named Conan‚ a distinguished and warlike man, from whom was
35 descended Geoffrey, himself, too, an active warrior, who held the
sovereignty of the whole of Britanny. Now this man besought
Goslin, the then abbot of the monastery of Floriacum (Fleury),
who afterwards presided as archbishop over the church of the
Bituriges, to send over to him Felix, the monk, to restore the
40 monasteries which had been destroyed in his territory. Therefore,

in the year of the Lord’s incarnation, 1008, Felix was sent by the ΑΛ), 1008.
