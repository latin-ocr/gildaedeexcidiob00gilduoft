of rebellion, the treacherous lioness killed the rulers who had been
left behind by them to declare more fully, and to strengthen‚ the
enterprises of Roman rule. After this, when news of such deeds
was carried to the senate, and it was hastening with speedy army

5 to take vengeance on the crafty soxes, as they named them, there
was no preparation of a fighting fleet on sea to make a brave
struggle for country, nor a marshalled army or right wing, nor any
other warlike equipment on land. They present their backS,
instead of their shields, to the pursucrs, their necks to the sword,

10 while a chilling terror ran through their bones: they hold forth
their hands to be bound like women; so that it was spread far
and wide as a proverb and a derision : the Britons are neither lmive
in war nor in peace faithful.

7 The Romans therefore, having slain many of the faithless onCS,

151·eserving some for slavery, lest the land should be reduced to
destitution—return to Italy leaving behind them a land stripped of
wine and oil. They leave behind governors as scourges for the
backs of the natives, as a yoke for their necks, so that they should
cause the epithet of Roman slavery to cling to the soil, should

20 vex the crafty racc not so much with military force as with
whipS, and if necessary, apply the unsheathed sword, as the saying
is, to their sides⁴ In this way the island would be regarded not as
Britannia but as Romania, and whatever it might have of copper,
silver, or gold would be stamped with the image of Caesar.

8 Meanwhile, to the island stiff with frost and cold, and in a far
distant corner of the earth, remote from the visible sun, He, the
true sun, even Christ, first yields His rayS‚ I mean His precepts.
He spread, not only from the temporal firmament‚ but from the
highest arc of heaven beyond all times, his bright gleam to the

30 whole world in the latest days, as we know, of Tiberius Caesar. At

 

Roman power in Britain, the Britons discontinued the art of coining.”
Reference is made there, in a note, to the present passage of Gildas as “ con-
firming this opinion.'⁷ Such confirmation is not possible if the view taken here
be correct, ί.ι’., that Gildas has selected the expedition of Hadrian as his
§mining—point, unless Gildas is erroneously ascribing· to the time of Severus
what had already taken place in the time of Claudius. The work of Severus
in Britain was, however, far more effective than anything that could be accom—
plished with the limited occupation secured under Claudius. Moreover, while
it was quite natural that Roman coins should be current in Britain from an
early period, the policy of forbidding Eritish coinage was barely possible until
the time of Severus, and it is something of this kind that is implied in the
words of Gildas. It is curious that the name of no emperor later than Constans
(AX). 337-350) is sound on inscriptions in Britain.
