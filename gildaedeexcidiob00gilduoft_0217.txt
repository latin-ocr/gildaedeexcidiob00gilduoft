The Ruin of Britain. 205

and sacrifices, I will not accept them. And J will not regard the
salvation proclaimed by yon. T ake away from me the souna' of thy
songs, and the (psalm) melody of thy instruments I will not hear,
because famine of Gospel food, the very sare which eats away the

5 bowels of your soul, is raging among you, as the prophet named
above has foretold. Behold, he says, the days come, saith the Lord, Amos viii, 11.
that I will send a famine in the land—not a famine of bread nor a
thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lora', and
the waters shall be moved from sea to sea, and from the north unto

10 the east ,· they shall run to and fro, secking the word of the Lora' and
shall not find it.

86 Understand also with your ears the holy Micah as he, like a
heavenly tmmpet, sounds forth very concisely against the crafty
princes of the people. Hear now, he says, ye princes (ff the house Mz'calz iii·1·12

15 of sacob. Is it not for you to know jndgrment, though ye hate the
good and seek the evil, plucking their slein from οβ’ them, and their
flesh from off their bones? How have they eaten the flesh of my
people and flayed their skins from off them, have broken their bones
and chopped them as flesh in the canldron? They shall cty unto

²0 God and he will not hear them, and he will hide his face from them
at that time, because they have behaved themselves ill in their
imaginings. Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make
my people to err, that bite with their teeth and ciy unto them, Peace,
though it (peace) is not put into their mouth ‚· I have stirrea' up

25 war against them (i.e.‚ people). Therefore night shall be unto yon
in consequence of your vision and darkness shall be anto yon in conse-
quence of divining, and the sun shall go down upon the prophets and
the day shall be darle over them⁷ then shall the seers of dreams be
confounded and the diviners mochea', and they themselves shall dewy

30 against all becanse there shall not be that heareth them. l shall
surely fill my strength with the Spirit of the Lord, and with
Judgment and might, to declare unto the house of jacob its impieties
and to Israel his sins. Hear this therefore ye leaders of the house of
Jacob and the residue of the house oflsrael‚ that abhorjudgment and

35 pervert equity, that build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with

 

Micah and Malachi at greater length than any other of the minor Prophets,
the word implies that even Micah speaks with greater brevity than might be
expected.
⁶ Adinventionz'bus = ἐν τοῖς ἐπιτηδεύμασιν. 7 Contenebrescel = συσκοτάσει.
8 Si ego non implevero. See c. 36 and p. 93, on a different form of this
verse3 the Hebraism sz' non implevero is in imitation of ἐὰν μὴ ἐμπλήσω,
implying strong affirmation : cf. Heb. iv, 3, as an instance of the contrary.
