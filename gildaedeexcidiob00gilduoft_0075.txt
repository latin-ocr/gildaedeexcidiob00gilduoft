of almost the last great slaughter inflicted upon the rascally crew.
And this commences, a fact Ι know, as the forty-fourth year, with
one month now elapsed 3 it is also the year of my birth. But not
even at the present day are the cities of our country inhabited as
sformerly; deserted and dismantled, they lie neglected until now,
because, although wars with foreigners have ceased, domestic wars
continue. The recollection of so hopeless a ruin of the island, and of
the unlooked- for help, has been fixed m the mcmory of those who
have survived as witnesses of both marvels. Owing to this (aid)
10 kings, magistrates, private persons, priests, ecclesiastics, severally
preserved their own rank. As they died away, when an age had
succeeded ignorant of that storm, and having experience only of the
present quiet, all the controlling influences oftruth and justice were
so shaken and overturned that, not to speak of traceS, not even the
15 remembrance of them is to be found among the ranks named

 

far better to regard the words adventus corum in Britanniam as Beda's
own interpretation of Gildas. Ussher (vol. V, p. 544) holds that Beda has mis-
understood Gildas's words, and gives himself the following paraphrase of the
passage: ‘⁴ perinde ac si (lavisset, a clade Badonica quadragesimum quartum
lunc (tempore quo scripta ab eo ista sunt) numerari cepisse aunuum um'co
quippe anni illius mense adhuc elapsoj idque ex sua [βείω αι’ίιῑίε se novissel'
“ As if he had said that from the loss inflicted at Badon, the forty-fourth year
had then (at the time he wrote> begun to be counted; one month in fact of that
year was gone, and this he knew from his own age.⁷’ Mommsen feels that the
passage can hardly give a good meaning, and, though reluctantly‚ proposes
an emendation ofit. The difficulty, he feels, lies in the strange ut novi, but if the
sentence be read : quique quadragesimus quartus [est ab eo qui] orditur annus
mense iam uuo emenso, qui el meac nativitatis est, then the meaning is perfectly
clear. (Mon. Germ. Hist„ iii, p. 8.) When we think of the many involved
scraggy sentences which Gildas writes elsewhere, we do not wonder at the ul
novi, which the recollection of his own age forced to an undue prominence
before his mind: by inserting it in brackets the sentence is tolerably easier‚
and can only give the meaning deduced by Ussher‚ and favoured by Mommsen.

² The description given here of the atrocities perpetrated in this invasion
is so definite in details that it must have come to Gildas from eye-witnesses.
He himself saw the ruined cities‚ desertae dirutaeque hactenus squalent
(chapter 26).

3 A very new and, to many, startling explanation of these words is given
by Mr. A. Anscombe in Arademy, September Sth, 1895. “ The phrase insulae
excidii (mentio) has been assumed to refer to the loss of the island of Britain
by the Britons : it, of course, refers to the occupatiori of Mon, or Anglesey‚ by
Edwin of Deira (617-633).'' This way of explaining the phrase seems to me
to be completely set aside hythe last words of chapter 23. “ They (the Saxons)
declare that they would break the treaty and lay waste all parts of the island
(Britain).⁷' Insula must have the same meaning in that passage and this.
