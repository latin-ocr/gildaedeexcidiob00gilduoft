GILDAE LORICA. THE LORICA OF G1LDAs.

THE name Lorica is applied to this Hymn and to a number of
others of like character, as implying a prayer of invocation for
supernatural protection against the evils of life, but more
particularly against pestilence and other dangers of death. The
idea underlying the name is probably derived from Ephes. vi, 14,
where the Apostle bids his readers stand, “having put on the
breast-plate of righteousness‚’' which words in the Latin version
read induti lorica iustitiae. With these words in mind, the writer
of the Hymn makes use of lorica twice in the course of his prayer ;
so that, as the idea grew that the recitation of the prayer, or
similar ones, did provide protection against the dangers of
pestilence or sickness‚ the Hymn itself acquired this appellation.
It is called a Lorica; it is called the “ Lorica of Gillas” in the
Preface which precedes it in the Irish MS. called the Leablmr
Breac (in VVelsh, Y Llyfr Bryclc, or Speckled Book), now in the
library of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin. Now Gillas, or
Gillus, is a common form for Gildas, especially in lrish documentS,

εις, for instance,
“The ite of Cluain Credail Gillasque‚'⁷

in the Annals of ngeyvmcll, or “Gillas obiit,” in the Annals
of Ulster,· the Bern MS. of Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia
Regma Britanniae, xii, 6,1·eads,“cum Gillas historicus testatur.''
We may, therefore, take the evidence of the writer of this
Preface‚ so far as it goes, that there was an early tradition in

Ireland which connected the Lorica printed in this volume with
Gildas, the author of the De Excidio. The colophon in the MS.
from which Mone first of all printed the Hymn attributes it to
“Lathacan the Irishman” (Explicit hymnus quem Lathacan
Scotigena fecit), and the same, we can hardly doubt, is the
meaning of Lodgen . . . . constituit, in the Preface of
another MS. If we look at the first-mentioned Preface‚ as
printed below, we see that it involves the chronological error
of making Gildas and Laidcenn contemporaries, whereas a whole
century intervened between them. Zimmer suggests a way of
