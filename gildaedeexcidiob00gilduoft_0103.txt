“On Origen's Revision of the LXX Text of Job⁷' (Essays in Biblical Greek,
p. 214). The oldest Latin version was made from the defective ante-Hexaplar
text of the LXX, and, therefore, did not contain thelines added by Origen from
Theodotion ι “ It is met with in the quotations of Cyprian and Lucifer of
Cagliari ; in Spain it survived to the fifth <eighth ?) century, as is shown by the
Speculum and Priscillian'⁷ (T ares and Stadios, iv, 3). lez's work of Gildas
shows tlaat z‘tz Britain it survz‘ved lo tlze salt-sla cenlmy, that is, we have in the
De Excidio Latin fragments of the Book of Job, and probably of Ezekiel and
the Minor Prophets, which represent a text older than Origen, or, roughly
speaking, anterior to ΑΛ). 250.

2. Putting aside this particular case of Job and the Minor Prophets, one may
mark what seems to be made plain by Nestle in the article in Herzog’s third
edition, that for the Old Testament the many variations of text existing, lead
us to the assumption ofa more numerous classification of groups than is the
case with the New Testament* The opinion advanced by Dr. Hort regarding
the New Testament—“ that the African was the parent of the European text,
having undergone revision when it travelled northwards, and been in some
measure adapted to the needs ofa more highly-cultivated population '³ (vol. ii,
p. 79>—this view seems in the main adopted by all. I cannot pretend to the
special training and qualification necessary to distinguish these in the text of
Gildas. My sole point is the interest which attaches to the fact, that Britain by
its isolation from the Empire, preserved, as to the Old Testament particularly, a
form of text that can be pronounced to be very ancient, and yet entered so far
into the common life of the Church, that the Vulgare osserome circulated in it,
apparently to a wider extent than was the case in Gaul. The results of minute
inquiry into the form of text used by Avitus and Gregory of Tours in Gaul, by
M. Samuel Berger in his Histoire de la Vulgata, seem to prove this con-
clusively.

It seems to be generally accepted that aster the middle of the fourth century
a third type of text is met with, due to various revisions of the European text.
Instances of it are found in the “ Codex Brixianus and a small group of Latin
authorities.'² The pages of Gildas show us that this also was current in
Britain. Further, the circulation of the old and new versions, side by side, too
often led to the production of what is called a mixed text, both versions fre-
quently borrowing and corrupting the text of the other, of which, again,
evidence is not wanting in the present book. To sum up, we may re-state that,
amid the terrible sufferings, which on the Continent led to the tragic events of
410 and 476 ; at a time when, in Britain, Picts and Scots were committing untold
ravages, and the Saxons carrying on a more awful war of extermination and
enslavement, a new Latin Bible steadily made its way to general acceptance.

3. In this island the revised New Testament, and certain parts of the
Old, had secured a general recognition. Yet the different parts of Scripture

 

’Ἀ Neben der afrikanischen Grundlage glauben aber neuere Forscher vor
allem beim NT., aber auch beim AT., ein entschieden europaisches element in
diesen Texten erkennen zu sollen, und es ist Sitte geworden, eine afrikanische

noch viel mehr Texte zuganglich sein, ehe an eine definitive Klassifikation
gedacht werden kann. (Herzog, Realemycl„ iii, 28.)
