'slze ann of Britain. 109

43 Receive one who truly and publicly assents to these words,
when he declares the recompense of your good and evil, with no
disguise of flattery; not as the mouths of your flatterers whisper
respectable poisonous things into yOU¹‘ ears.

5 Also, directing hisjudgment against rapaciousjudges, he speaks
thus: T lly princes are nnfaz'tlzsnl compam'ons of tln'eves,· tltey all lsm'alai,23,24.
love gifts and follow after rewards ,· tlnyjndge not tlte satllerless, and
the canse of tlte wz'dow contetlt not anto tlzenl. Tllerefore saitlt tlze
Lord of hosts, tlte M zglzty One of lsrael: An J I sllall be clteered

10 witlt respect to nt y enenlz‘es, and be avenged of my adversaries ‚· and lsaz'alz i, 28.
tlte lleinons transgressors and tlte sz'nners sltall be crnslzed
togetlter and destroyed, and all wlto llave abandoned tlte Lord lsaialc ii. 11·
sltall be consnnted. Also below : T lle eyes of tlte lffty man [saian iii, 11.
shall be ltnntbled, and tlte llanglltiness of men slzall be bowea' down.

15 Again: W oe nnto tlte wiclced sor evil, sor tlte reward of ln's hands
sltall be nnto ltine. A little after : Woe nnto yon tltat rise np early lsasalz v, 11-14*
to follow after drnnleenness, and to drl‘nk nntz'l tlte evening, nntt'l ye
are inflamed wz'tlt wine. 'she lzarp, tlte lyre, tlte tabat tlte pipe and
wine are in yonrseasts; and tlze work of tlte Lordye regard not, and

20 tlte work of His ltands ye consider not. Themfore zny people ltave
been led captive, becanse tlley leave not lead knowleagre,· and tlzez'r
ltononrable men leave peris-ned witll fann‘ne, and their ncnltitnde leave
parelzea' wz'tlt tltz'rst. Theresore ltell ltatlt enlarged lter sonl, and opened
lter montlt witlcont J'neasnre .· and tltet'r strong ones and their nznltz'-

2 5 tude, tlzeir losty and renowned ones, slzall descend nnto it. And below :

Woe nnto tlzeln tllat are nngltty to drink wine, and men <ff strength ls‹12'as2v,22-25.
to mingle drmzlcenness,· wltojnstz'sy tlte wickedsorrewards, and talee
away tlte rzgltteonsness of tlze rzgrlneons from llz'nl. Because of tln's,
as tlzefire devonretlt stnbble, and tlte lzeat of tlte flante bnrnetlt wood,

30 so sltall tlzez‘r root be as embers, and their blossonz sllall go np as

despz'sed tlte word of tlte Holy One of lsrael. ln all tln‘s tlle anger
of tlte Lord z's not tnrned away, bnt His stand z's stretclled ont still.

44 And after some further words, treating of the day of judg-

35 ment and the unspeakable sear of sinners, he says: Howlye,15ffl·ffi xiii,
because tlte day of tlte Lord z's at leand—if it was then near, what 6⁴¹·
shall be thought now P—becanse destruction sllall conte frona God.
leemy‘ore sltall all llands be nnloosea', and every lzeart o man
