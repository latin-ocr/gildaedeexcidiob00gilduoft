munion of churches. The silence of Gildas respecting “ imposition of hands''
may be due to the fact that a rite which he found used in so many other
functions, such as the reconciliation of penitents‚ the ordination of exorcists by
presbyters, and at the chrism of catechumens, had not the distinctive meaning,
in his eyes, which the act of unction had. The omission is, nevertheleSS.
striking. We are not discussing the position and significanee attached by
the Church to any symbolical act in the rite of ordination, as held in Britain
about the year A.D. 5403 we are endeavouring to understand the silence
of a single writer—the only writer, as it happens, that has described for
us the ordination of priests in that age. On the whole, it appears reasonable to
conclude that ordination would be carried on in Britain, almost in the same
way as the rite is prescribed in such Gallic Ordines as the Missale Francorum,
Martene's Ordines, or, in a less degree, the sacramentarizmz Gelasiamcmff*

It is an equally probable conclusion that the canonical regulations, the due
observance of which constituted that legitime ordinari upon which Gildas so
frequently insists, would be the same as those found in the canons of the Statum
Ecclesiae Antiqua, though when we speak of similarity or identity, we should
reserve something in favour of the presumption of greater simplicity in Britain.
The silence of Gildas can in no way bar such a conclusion, though it must
impress us as to the things which lle regarded as having real importance and
special meaning—the hands of bishops and presbyters'received unction, there
was a consecration of thern, to which the stamp of authoritative sanction
came from the words of Holy Scripture, specially selected for the occasion
and read in their hearing.

It does not require any very extensive reading of liturgic documents, written
in countries far apart‚ to notice that, in the midst of endless variety, which

ἥ The Missale Francorum is a compilation of Gallic liturgic rites drawn up,
according to Morinus, about the middle of the sixth century (before 560, but
by others placed at a later date. It is generally agreed that it certainly con-
tains materials considerably older than the time of compilation. The parts
referred to in this note are in vol. ii, p. 661 βξ of Muratori's Lilurgicz Romana
Vetus.

The Ordines of Martene mentioned above represent early usages of the
Church in Gaul: they contain canons for ordination as well as formulae of
service, and, in material, may represent a time approximating that os the
illsssale Francorum. They were printed by Martene in 1700, in a wovk
entitled: De Antl'qm's Ecclesiae lenibus. My references are to this edition,

representing seventh-century usages3 though chiefly Roman in source and
character, it contains (2altic material. “ Tout le rituel des ordres mineurs, tel
