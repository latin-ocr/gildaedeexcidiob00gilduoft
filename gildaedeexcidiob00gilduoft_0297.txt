after the reading is finished, let him repeat whatever the brethren
have sung, in due order. But if he come to the second reading,
let him go without his dinner.

20. If any one by mistake change anything of the sacred words
5 where “ danger’' is marked, let him observe a three days' fast
or three supmposz'tiones. ”

22. He that has of his own will defiled himself in his sleep, if

10 the monastery have plenty of beer and meat, shall keep vigil

for three hours of the night standing, provided he is really a

man of strength. If, however, the food be poor, let him, standing

as a suppliant, recite twenty-eight or thirty Psalms, or make
recompense by extraordinary work.

15 23. For good kings we ought to make the sacred offering‚ for
the bad not.

24. Presbyters are not prohibited from offering for their

20 one inconsiderate, let him go without dinner.

26. He that breaks a hoe that had previously no fracture,
should make restitution for it by extraordinary work, or should

27. Whoever shall see one of the brethren breaking the com-

25 mands of the Abbot, ought not to hide it from the Abbot 3 but let.
him previously admonish the sinner to confess, himself, to the

Abbot his evil deed; let him be found not so much an informer,

So far Gildas.

 

2 Pro bom's regibus. The terminology of this rule is familiar to every
student of Liturgic forms and of the ideas underlying them. In Britain, as in
other parts of the West‚ we see that the Eucharist is regarded as a sacrifice
which is ffred for men ; this conception is stamped upon Welsh tei-ininology,
because the word for “priest³' εἶα, offliriad= eff‘yrz'al, is not borrowed as in
other Celtic languages from sacerdos (e.g.‚ Irish, sacam) but from the verb
ψη ; so also ffren (z mass) is from offerenda.

These Rules (23, 24) are found as well in the Poen. Commeani (xiii, 1, 2),
and in the Poenis. Pseudo-Romanum (ix, 5, 6> both similarly related to the
Celtic (Irish) Penitential of Columbanus.
