83 De Excidio Britanniae.

loquaci tantum temeritate tales minas eis tantosque terrores incu-

[ω. x. 28, 29. sunt peccata huius temporis quam primi, apostolo dicente : Legem

The words used in this section have an important bearing upon the whole
contents of the book from the beginning as far as c. 63. Though the author
appears to hurl forth his denunciations broadcast, yet we must gather that he
has all along the five men already mentioned by name, chiefly in view. The
prophetie oracles, he says expressly, in the threats they contain, are to be
straightly spoken “against the afore-named five horses of Pharaoh's retinue
and their like.'' After waiting ten long yearS, his patience came to an end in
the enormities witnessed “this year,'' when the Prince of Domnonia, disguised
as an abbot, murdered two royal youths in church. Eritish law and custom,
as we know from the laws of Howell the Good, allowed divorce under condi-
tions which the Christian ehurch had no choice except to condemn. Every
one of these five had been guilty of forcible divorce, accompanied by other
crimes, and the old cry of Jerome against Roman imperial law repeats itself in
this work ofa Briton: “The laws ofthe Caesars are different from those of Christ ;
Papinianus (a Jurist) prescribes one thing, Paul another'⁷ (Aliae sunt leges
Caesarum, aliae Christi. Aliud Papinianus, aliud Paulus praecipit, Ep, 77).
There is here no empty declamation, but a truthful man with instances of real
criminality before his mind, bearing witness, like one of the Hebrew prophetS,
and availing himself of their words, sor righteousness and good living. We
have before us, in fact, a page in the large volume of the history of morals.

 

ADD ITIONAL NOTE.
C homelea* os she Scripturas quotations made by Gildas.

Gildas gives three reasons for the long extracts of Scriptural passages
which follow. (1) He does not wish to be regarded as timid or incapable of
proper discrimination. (2) By quoting the sayings of the prophets, he renders
his work safe against the attacks of the envious. (3) Such extracts will prove
that there is something more than lais own ideas in his pleadings and
(lenunciations.

Severe coniments, or depreciatory ones, have often been passed on Gildas
for filling his tractate with mere quotations. It is certainly not the method of
a modern writer, but greater men than Gildas had, before his time, made this an
established sashiou in Christian literature. Cyprian, in his Testimom'a ad
Qm‘m'nmn and the tractate Ad Fortunatam (de exhortatione Asazrzyriz'), writes
of questions bearing on doctrine and morality, by means of far more numerous
and extensive quotations of Scripture passages strung together, than Gildas.

 

 

¹ duobus mediis vel tribus. There seems to be here an echo of an older
version than the Vulgum, which is as follows : irritam qzsz'sfirciens legem Uose'
. duobus vel tribus ausibus moritur .· quanto magis palatis . .
