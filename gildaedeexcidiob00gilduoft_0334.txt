BEATUS GILDAS ARECLUTA1 fertilissima regione oriundus, patre 1
Cauno'2 nobilissimo et catholico viro genitus, ab ipso puerili aevo
toto mentis affectu Christum studuit sequi. Arecluta autem regio

 

¹ Areclula. This name is a compound of the preposition ιῖνέ, modern
Welsh ar, meaning on or opposite, ancl Cluta, the ancient name for the river
Clyde. Ptolemy calls the Firth of Clyde the Clota Estuary‚ which may here
remind us oflurz'ca for lorica, and the many instances found of Latin 0 becoming
u in the sixth and succeeding centuries. Are— is found extensively in Celtic
countries‚ as Are-late (Arles), Are-trigium‚ Ar(e)morica‚ Are-dumum, etc., so
that Are-eluta would mean “on Clyde,'⁷ or “opposite Clyde.” This form
with ar, it is almost unnecessary to add, is very common in modern Welsh.
The river's name as Clut is met with also in Amaci, or Ailcluith—the British
name for Dunbrettan (i.e.‚ the fortress of the Erythons), or as now known,
Dumbarton‚ the probable birthplace of St. Patrick.

We may remind ourselves in this place that Ussher made current the
previously—surmised distinction between Gildas Albanius and Gildas Badanicus,
holding that the latter was the author of the De Excidio and lived a considerable
time after the former, who was contemporary with King Arthur. The writer
ofthis Lffe, according to Ussher, has confounded the two (Gildam Badonicum

. .et G. Albanium in unum complavit); while the next Vita by Caradoc,
with which he was acquainted, gives us an account of Gildas Albanius (vol. v,
506, or c. xiii). In the Index Chronologicus the birth of Gildas Albanius is
assigned by him to A.D. 425 ; that of Gildas Badonicus to 525. In· reference to
the inadequate grounds upon which these theories of two, or even three
Gildases hare been advanced, and their abandonment by our (lay, I need at
present do no more than quote the apt words of Scholl: ‘⁴ Uncertainty as to
times is no reason for assuming two Gildases. But what is of greater weight,
all the evidence, both ancient and mediaeval, is silent of a second Gildas ; we
cannot too much wonder how, if a man os such character and greatness had
existed, that no mention whatever os him is to be found in the pages os Gildas,
Beda, the &Velsh Anam, and in fact all writers. We must therefore reject that
conjecture of the existence of two Gildases (duosfin'sse Gildas), which, like
other numberless conjectures, has come from the workshop (officina) of Bale
and Pits, who, because disinclined to reject discrepancies, divided them between
two persons'' (De [ἵει-[ιτς. Bt: Remorumque llis-'leriae Fontfhm, p. 3).
