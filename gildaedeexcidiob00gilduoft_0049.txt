Τήϊε Rm'n of Britain. 37

cavalry on land and of sailors by sea, before long they plunge their
terrible swords in the necks of the enemies; the massacre they inflict
is to be compared to the fall of leaves at the fixed time, just like
a mountain torrent, swollen by numerous streams after stormS,
sweeps over its bed in its noisy course; with furrowed back and
fierce look, its waters, as the saying goeS, surging up to the clouds
(by which our eyeS, though osten refreshed by the movements of
the eyelids, are obscured by the quick meeting of lines in its broken
eddies)‚ foams surprisingly, and with one rush overcomes obstacles
set in its way. Then did the illustrious helpers quickly put to flight
the hordes of the enemy beyond the sea, if indeed escape was at all
possible for them: for it was beyond the seas that they, with no
one to resist, heaped up the plunder greedily acquired by thern year
by year.

The Romans, therefore, declare to our country that they could
not be troubled too frequently by arduous expeditions of that
kind, nor could the marks of Roman power, that is an army of such
size and character, be harassed by land and sea on account of un-
warlike, roving, thieving fellows They urge the Britons, rather,
to accustom themselves to armS, and fight bravely, so as to save
with all their might their land, property, wives, children, and, what
is greater than these, their liberty and life: they should not, they
urge, in any way hold forth their hands armourless to be bound by
nations in no way stronger than themselves, unless they became

25 effeminate through indolence and listlessness ; but have them pro-

vided with bucklers, swords and spears, and ready for striking.
Because they were also of opinion that it would bring a consider-
able advantage to the people they were leaving, they construet a
wall, different from the other, by public and private contributions‚

 

 

note, p. 34. Gildas speaks of two walls being built, one of turs, the other of
stone : in fact, the two walls had been so constructed from the first, the stone
wall in A.D. 122, the turf in A.D. 143, so that his words can imply no inore than
the repairing of them, though the repairs needed, after so many years of neglect
and ruin, must have been extensive in the extreme.
