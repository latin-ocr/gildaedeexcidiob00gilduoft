96 De Excidio Britanniae.

The conclusion is that Gildas himself translafed the places named above from
the Greek, whence we know thas, sar those limes, he was well acquainlea' wille
tlte Greek langue (Gz'ldam {fisum locos supra enumeratos ex Graeco verlzlvseffmde
illum Graecae linguae ut istis temporibus peritissimum ficz'sse cognoscimus).’'
The same view is given in an English book read and consulted by every student ε
“ His special renderings are commonly made from the LXX (once or twice
apparently from the Hebrew), and from a text of the LXX agreeing partly with

the MS. Vat.‚ partly with the MS. Alex.⁷⁷ “ But Gildas uses a form of that
version (Aa, the Latin) corrected occasionally from the G1·eek.”⁹⁶ The notes
in the careful and exhaustive collation of the text of Gildas with other Latin
texts, made in the same work, frequently add ; “corrected in accordance with
the LXX.’'

3. Another explanation is possible, and, to me, far more probable. The
Greek text which forms the basis of a great part of Gildas’ Latin text is older tlmn
that ofthe LXX found in any MS„ because all these give an emended text as
revised by Origen, and therefore his agreement, or disagreement, with the text
of Codex Alex„ or Codex Vat„ counts for very little. This may not be the case
for all parts of Gildas, for I find, in comparing the old Latin used by Jerorne,
in his Commentaries on the Prophets, with the quotations of Gildas, that the
former is at times more literally near the LXX. Still the principle which will
furnish the true explanation and should guide us is this—that tlze rzeczrera textos

tlte Latin version is to tlte Greek os the LXX, tlte older z‘t is. Ι find this principle
enunciated by a French writer, M. C. Douais, who, in 1895, published “ Une
ancienne version latine de l'Ecclesiastique.⁷'
must be that the texts which are zmlz'lee that ofthe LXX, are really the “corrected''
ones. While such rude Latin as,filz'z’sine lege for υἱοὶ ἄνομοι, or, lzgrmmz sine
sanitate (c. 59) for ξῦλον ἀνίατον, or further, salutare declarationis vestrae non
acczpiam (c. 85), in correspondence with the Greek of A, σωτηρίου ἐπιφανείας
ὑμῶν οὐκ ἐπιβλέψομαι-411656, by their literal agreement with the Greek, are
proved to be older and non-corrected forms. Whether Gildas himself knew
Greek will be considered elsewhere, and on other grounds; at present, we
simply dwell upon facts which certainly seem to warn us against founding any
argument whatever as to a supposed study of the Greek tongue, and acquaintance
with it in the monasteries of Britain, upon the peculiarities of Old Testament
quotations found in this book. Gildas simply wrote his Latin of Job, Ezekiel,
or Amos, just as he found it in the codices of his time. The close resemblance
of this to the ancient Greek version, as the marked agreement of Ranke's
fragment shows, cannot be due to Gildas; it just proves how extremely old
some parts of the Bible used in Britain must have been, but can prove no more.
Resides the fragment published by Ranke, the Extracts from the Old Testament,
printed in lladdan and Stubl)s, i, App. G, p. 195, from a supposed British
Old Latin Versum, in their partial agreement with Gildas, seem also to
support the view given above.

4. The exceedingly close agreement between the Latin of Gildas and the
Greek of the LXX has led me to take a very bold step. In some passages,
even the scanty documentary evidence existing for determining the text of the
De Excidio is conflicting, while in one οι· two places there is evident corruption,

Led by such a view, our conclusion
