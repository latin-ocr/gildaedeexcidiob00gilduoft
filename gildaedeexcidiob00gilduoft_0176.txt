164 De Excidio Britamzme.

inter altaria stantes ; plebem ob peccata non corripientes, nimirum
eadem agentes ; praecepta Christi spernentes et suas libidines votis
omnihus implere curantes ; sedem l'etri apostoli¹ inmundis pedihus
usurpantes, sed merito cupiditatis*2 in Iudae traditoris pestilentem
cathedram decidentes, veritatem pro inimico odientes et mendaciis
ac si carissimis fratribus faventes; iustos inopes immanes quasi
angues torvis vultibus conspicantes et sceleratos divites absque
ullo verecundiae respectu sicut caelestes angelos venerantes;
egenis eleemosynam esse dandam summis e labiis praedicantes,
sed ipsi vel obolum non dantes: nefanda populi scelera tacentes
et suas iniurias quasi Christo irrogatas amplificantes; religiosam
forte matrem seu sorores domo pellentcs³ et externas veluti
secretiori ministerio familiares indecenter levigantes vel potius, ut
vera dicam licet inepta non tam mihi quarn talia agentibus,

 

¹ Sea'em Petri apostoli. We seem to have in this phrase, as in Pelri
cathedra, the sui-vival of a belief that had died out elsewhere. It means that
eva bishop is regarded as a successor of Peter, just as every hishop's chair
is a sedes apostolica (c. 92> : such appears to have been the saith of the Church
in Britain when Gildas wrote. If we look up the writings of Tertullian and
Cyprian, comparing them with the Tractare De Aleatoribus (supposed now
to have been written at Rome itself), we find a living conviction that every
bishop is a successor of Peter; that his position is marked by the cathedra
Petri to which he has been called. Tertullian states, in Scorp. 10, that “the
Lord had given the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Peter, and by him to the
Church (fier eum ccclesiae reliquisse).²’ In the De Pudicitia, 21, he is indignant
that the bishop of Rome (Callistus) should appropriate to himself the power os
binding and loosing which really appertains “to every church belonging to
I'eter7' <ad omnem ecclesiam Petri propinquam). It is true that these last
passages are strongly marked by the Montanist leanings of Tertullian, but the
same idea is very prominent in Cyprian. To him the bishop of Rome was the
successor of Peter, nevertheless he has the whole episcopate in mind ; it was,
‘⁴ in ordering the office of the bishop and the course of his Church in the Gospel,
that he says to Peter'' (quoting Matth. xvi, 18, eto), Ep. 33, 1 z “There is
one God, one Christ, one Church, and one chair, founded on Peter by the word
of the Lord (mm ecclesia el cathedra mm super Petrum Domini voce fistulata),
Ep. 43, 5. The question itself is not to be touched upon here, but the his-
torica] survival of phrases that once had a peculiar meaning is of interest.
One might refer as to these views in the African and other Churches during the
early third century, to Sohm's Kircllenrecllt, 251-256; Harnack, Texta mul
(slllcrs., v, ῐ, 73-76. There is certainly a temptation to draw, as regards Britain, a
conclusism which is evident in the case of'l'ertullian and Cyprian. In their case,
many such sayings as those quoted are reminiscent of the fact, that the Church
os Africa had received its teaching from Rome ; such a conclusion would hardly
he contested But may we not find in this use os the phrase “ chair of Peter‚'⁵
sor the whole episcopato, an indication of very carly Roman influence upon the
ideas prex-ailing among the Christian communities in Britain also?
