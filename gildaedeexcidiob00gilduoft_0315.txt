T lae Lorica of Gildas. 303

and inadequate to warrant the conclusion that these productions
are to be pronounced as belonging to a sixth-century Eritish
literary activity that began with Illtud in South Wales. Zimmer's
contention, in Nenm'us Vindz'catus (s, 311), and in the Gottingen
Naclzriclzten‚ that the Latin is quite unlike the Latin of Irish
writers of the seventh century, Columbanus of Bobbio, Gallus,
etc., seems perfectly just and cogent3 but, on the other hand, there
remains to be considered the not-infrequent instances of similarity,
as to matter and language, to the Irish Hymns and to the Lorica os
Leydem even the strange word iduma, meaning “hand,'' appears
in the Altus Prosator, v. 70,

“ Suffultus dei iduma omnipotentis ualida,’'

as well as dodrans, tz'tlzzlr, also Gildasian rare words, barathrum,
ergastulum, and substantives ending in -men,

Here we may recur to what was said above respecting the
content of the Lorz‘ca of Gildas ε mention ofgrades and angels and

angelic powers would hardly be forthcoming in Latin before the
time of Gregory the Great—that is, until after A.D. 600-but this
Hymn reveals the idea in a highly developed form; so also do
the Irish Hymns dating from the second half of the seventh
century, especially those having the character of loricae. May we
not conclude that our Lorica is a production of that time, but yet
have its origin in a country related both to Brittany and to
Ireland? Gildas is the only writer that would furnish a name
representative of this relation; and when we examine the four
notices, contained in three Prefaces and a colophon, somewhat
closely, the information they furnish us may be presented as
follows: Of the four documents‚ the earliest of all says that
Laidcenn ordaz'ned or appointed (constituit) it to be used ; another
simply relates that he was in the habit of singing it 3 but a third
asserts that Gildas composed, and Laidcenn brought it over to
Ireland for public use.¹ It seems not rash to believe that it is the
work of some unknown writer, who, late in the seventh century
belonged to that South-VVales-British circle where Gildas’s name
was pre-eminent, and, therefore, is not of the time of Gildas him-
self, nor by him. Yet it claims place and notice in this volume.

 

¹ In reference to the implication conveyed by constituit and the action of
Laidcenn, according to the Preface in Β, we may note that the Book ofArmaglc
sets down the recitation of St. Patrick⁷s Loriccz in the Liturgy‚ as the fourth
honour due to him throughout all the churches and monasteries of Ireland:

its recitation was regarded as very efficacious.
