folly, and destitute of a leader.

16 The legion returned home in great triumph and joy when their
old enemies‚ like rapacious wolves, fierce with excessive hunger,

5 jump with greedy maw into the sold, because there was no shepherd

in sight. They rush across the boundarieS, carried over by wings
of oars, by arms of rowerS‚ and by sails with fair wind. They slay
everything, and whatever they meet with they cut it down like a
ripe crop, trample under foot and wall< through.

17 Again suppliant messengers are sent with rent clothes, as is
said, and heads covered with dust.

Crouching like timid fowls under the trusty wings of the parent]
birds‚they ask help of the Romans, lest the country in its wretched-l
ness be completely swept away, and the name of Romans, which to

³ This second expedition of the Romans against the Scots and Picts must
have taken place before A.D. 407, in which year the tyrannus 01· usurper, Con-
stantine, left Britain ior Gaul. We are able to fix the possible time for the two
expeditioris No forces could be spared during the five years' reign of Maximus
(383-388), nor during the struggles of Constantine (407—411) ; we are thus
limited to a period of about eighteen years, 389-407. The arrangements for
defence described in the next section may have been Constantine⁷s plans and
efforts to make Britain secure in his rear. His departure proved to be the final
abandonment of Britain by the Empire.
