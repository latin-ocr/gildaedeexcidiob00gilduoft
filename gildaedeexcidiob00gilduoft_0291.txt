obedience; after one year and a half he may take the Eucharist
and corneto communion ; let him sing the Psalms with his brethren,
lest his soul be lost completely, by so long a time of the heavenly
discipline.

5 2. If a monk placed in a lower grade commit the same sin, he
is to do penance for three yearS, but let the measure of his bread
be hcavier. If a workman, let him take a Roman pint of mill<
and another of whey, and as much water as suffices to quench his
thirst.

10 3. But if a presbyter or deacon‚ without a monk's vow, sin, let
his penance be similar to that of a moni< without orders.

4. Ifa monk intend to commit a sin, his penance shall be for
one year and a half. The Abbot, however, has authority to
moderate in this matter, if the monk's obedience be pleasing to

15 God and to his Abbot.

5. The ancient fathers have fixed twelve years of penance for a
presbyter, seven for a deacon.

 

 

ing rule in the Penitential of Egbert (V, 12). That of Cuminean (ii, 25) reads,
post tale peccatum voluerit monachus fieri, z'.e.‚ if the sinner elect to become
a monk.

⁵ Antiqui patres. The “Fathers of old⁷⁷ in this rule cannot mean the
“Fathers’' of the Church as implying a decree by bishops or by a Synod;
apparently the only meaning is that which limits patres to the Church of
Britain itself. Therefore, when these 111165 were drawn up, the custom of
fixing varying periods of penance, according to the ecclesiastical grade of the
delinquent, had been in use for a length of time. That time had been long
enough 10 65131)11511 3 tradition ; 1)111 1116 tradition also witnessed to the fact that
the “ fathers'⁷ upheld afar severer code of discipline: instead of the three years
of the present rule, they ordained for a presbyter twelve years of penance and
seven for a deacon. The “Book of David⁷⁷ prescribes, as well, twenty-three
years sor a bishop, being itself, perhaps, a reminiscence of the old order.
Auliqui decrevere sancti, ut episcopus pro capitalibus peccatis mviii annis
peniteat, presbiler xii, diaconus viz· (c. Io). See p. 286.

The whole tone of ecclesiastical procedure, in the fourth and fifth centuries‚
against offending clerics, bishops, presbyters and deacons, as may be seen by
a perusal of Thomassinus, Vetus et lVowz Ecclesiae Disciplina, Part ΙΙ, Lib. i,
cc. 56-58‚ or Hinschius, Kz‘rclzenreclzt, iv, ξ 247, is different from what is
implied in the present rule ofa specified time of penance. When, therefore,
we find that in the writings of Columbanus‚ the frequent reference to patres and
magistri nostri, leads us solely to think of eminent Irish (and Welsh> abbots,
such as Finnian, Comgall, and Gildas‚ we naturally conclude that a similar
implication is to be deduced from the words of this 11116. Τ11611 we are
carried further, that is, to suspect that 501116 parts of this Penitential belong to
a date subsequent to Gildas. ln his time there were no venerable patres to
sustain ajudgment3 he himself became one of them for the next generation,
who lived about A.D. 600-650.
