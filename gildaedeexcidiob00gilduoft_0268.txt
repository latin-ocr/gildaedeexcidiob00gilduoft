what to him were modern times, when startling developments
were taking place, with the usual accompaniment of anxiety and
sober joy.

There were thus extant Letlers of Gildas that held a high place
in the estimation of the Churches of Britain and Ireland early in
the seventh century. Of this we have confirmatory evidence in a
letter of ColumbanuS, written about ΑΒ. 595-600, to Pope Gregory
the Great. (See the letter in full before Vita I.) In that letter,
while requesting the opinion of Gregory on three points, he
mentions the interesting fact that Gildas, or Giltas as he calls him,
had written of those bishops that were irregularly ordained, because
guilty of Simony. These words may be regarded as describing
the second main part of Gildas’ De Excidio (cc. 62-110).1 But
Columbanus further mentions a correspondence between Vennianus
and Gildas, respecting the monks who were abandoning their
monasteries for the better seclusion of desert places. Seebass,
in Zeitsclzrz'ft s. Kipclzengesclziclzte, xiv, 437, concludes that
Vennianus must be, not Finnian, the founder of Clonard, who died
about 549, but Finnian of Maghbile (Moville), whose death is
placed by some in 588, by others in 610. The question is an
exceedingly difficult one, as the evidence seems conflicting and
confused; yet one is certainly safe in the assertion that a con-
siderable time must have intervened between the writing of the
De Excidio and the penning of letters that would supply such
