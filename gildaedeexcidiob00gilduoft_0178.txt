¹ T yrannico ritu. The next chapter not only enlarges upon the simony
practised by the clergy, but explains also how their ordination is irregular
and violent: the bishops and presbyters “steal the title of priest'' (rapto
sacerdolali nomine), because when thwarted in the church (parochia) for which
they seek ordination, and there refused, they sail across seas, to Gaul, perhaps,
or Ireland, and secure their object by bribes. It is sels-seeking men (ambitores)
that ordain them, against the will of those to whom it legitimately belonged.
We may surmise that, except where such base infiuences as are here described
operate and break through ecclesiastical usages, a bishop would be elected
by the whole community, so that “the episcopate should‚'' in the‘ words of
Cyprian, “be conferred upon him de universae fraternitam& szff*agz'0''
(Ep. 67, 5). The great Leo, writing to the bishops ofthe province of Vienne in
Gaul, just a hundred years before Gildas, insists that the “consent of clergy and
people'' (ordim's consensus esplebz's) should be duly observed ; adding that, “he
who is to preside over all must be elected by all ’' (Ep. 10, ὁ). Any bishop
ordained otherwise is ordained by a tyrannicus ritus.

In this contrast we have implied the great change that found its completion
during the sixth century. With the fall of the Empire fell also the schools of
the rhetoricians, which had kept alive the taste for the classic literature of
antiquity. They were replaced by Christian schools connected with the great
churcheS, or with monasteries; and in these, reading was confined to the works
of Christian writers, and chiefly those writings which inculcated asceticism and
monastic retirement. The celebrated dream of Jerome, of which he gives
a graphic account in his letter to Eustochium (Ep. 22, 30), shows how the feeling
of aversion to Pagan literature was, at the end of the fourth century, beginning
to carry even men of the highest equipment away from the great writers

of Greece ancl Rome. “What has Horace to do with the Psalter? what has
Maro in common with the Gospels? What has Cicero with the Epistles?⁷'
(cf. the 7th chapter in Ep. 53; Taceo. de mei similibus ..... >. In his

dream he found himself standing before the judgment-seat of Christ. He
had been reading Cicero and Plautus with delight, but felt a shudder at the
uncouth language of the prophets 3 when asked about his condition, his answer
