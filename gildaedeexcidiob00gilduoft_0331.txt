V ila G ildae. 3 19

the other writes, Ildutz' monasterium, εἰέκ, Illtud’s monastery. Two
of the Vitae use both llan and insula as equivalent to “m-onas-
tery'’; one of these agrees with the third in that meaning of llan 3
the three give an almost identical account of Illtud, his monastery,
school, and island. The narrow space of this island is widened in
answer to prayer, though the same happy transformation is made
also for the benefit of Paul's sister; we have the same story of the
wild birds, and not dissimilar accounts of a wonderful bell, and a
Codex of the Four Gospels.

In many leading characteristics these three Visae (for a special
reason Ι exclude now the Visa lllaclovii) belong to the same
country and to one period of time. Speaking more correctly‚ we
should say that, when considered as redactions of older and shorter
Vitae, they cannot be far distant srom one another in the date
at which they took their present form. We know that older
biographies supplied the basis sor the Life (ff Samson, and for that
os Paul of Leon ; it is not, therefore, improbable that there should
have existed similar material for the Life of Gz'ldas. There came
also, we know, a period of pious pilgrimages from Brittany to
WVales, whence so many saints had come during the sixth and
seventh centuries‚ during which pilgrimages the materials for these
Vitae might have been gathered by these Breton monks.

If we accept the suggestion that the sze os Gz'ldas has the
same original basis as the Life of Paul, then we may conclude
something as to the date; for VVermonoc tells us that he wrote
the latter, using an older Vita, hardly legible by age, in A.D. 884.
Ι am, however, drawn to believe that a close examination of the
two works will disclose a narrow limit to this basis, In the Lzse
of Paul, three companions are named as sharing with him the
teaching and discipline of the monastic school of Illtud‚·viz.‚
Devius (Dewi Sant, or David), Samson and Gyldas (sic); but the
Lzse of Gz'ldas omits all mention of David, the two Lives show
similar intimate acquaintance with Gildas' work printed above,
but to the one it is a writing on the Excz'dz‘nm Britanniae, to the
other on ormestal Britanniae. In both, the area of the small

 

¹ Ormesta is probably the same word as the Welsh gormes. This was
pointed out long ago by the late M. Gaidoz; -m may have been added to
Latinise the word, or the Welsh may have lost the final t. The well-known
historical work os Orosius, which had partly the same motive as the De Excidio
of (fildas, is rnade to bear this same name of Ormesta, but this again is due to
the reading of a Fleury MS.
