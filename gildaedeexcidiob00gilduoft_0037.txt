sequence the whole church‚ in close army, emulously leaving ’ ’
behind it the darkness of this world, was hastening to the pleasant
realms of heaven as to its own proper abode.

10 God, therefore, as willing that all men should be saved, magni-
fied his mercy unto ΗΞ, and called sinners no less than those who Ι Tim. ii. 4.
regard themselves righteous. He of His own free gift, in the above ¹⁴
mentioned time of persecution, as we conclude, lest Britain should

be completely enveloped in the thick darkness of black night,

 

also lost. Now, many of these acts of martyrdom are found void of all
details as to time and place, as, for instance, those condemned by the famous
Decretmn of Pope Gelasius in 496 (Hcfiffle, ii, 618) ; ifsuchaone had come into
the hands of Gildas, it was natural that he should conjecture the events there nar-
rated to have taken place in the last great persecution. One is tempted also to
notice a difference of reading found here in some codices, as possibly recording
a different, if not the original, tradition 3 these are, uellmmensis E, uellamien-
sem C, uellomiensem D. Nevertheless, it is, perhapS, safest to conclude that
Gildas found· Verulamium fixed in tradition as the place of suffering of a
martyr bearing the name Albanus, though it is not named in the account given
by the author of the Life of Germanus of a visit paid by the Gallie bishops
Germanus and Lupus (ΑΙ). 429) to the tomb of Alban : ‘⁴ The priests,'⁷ we read,
“ sought the blessed martyr Albanus in order to render thanks, by his mediation,
to God; where Germanus, having with him relics of all the apostles and of
different martyrs, offered prayer, and commanded the grave to be opened in
order to place there the precious gifts.'' (V. Germ, i, 25.) We can thus say
that Albanus was known and revered as a martyr c. 429, while the place of his
martyrdom appears for the first time in this chapter of Gildas' work. ln the
edition of Jerome's fllarzyrology, lately prepared by De Rossi and Duchesne <for
Aa. Ss.,Nov.,Tom. ΙΙ) one codex, the Cod. Bern. (c. A.D. 770), records ‘⁶ in Britain
was Albinus martyr, along with others, 889 in number, placed in the list of
those whose names are written in the book of life.⁷’ W'e are informed in the
l'rolegomena of several indicationS, that the exemplar from which this ΜΞ, was
copied had been in the possession of, or written by, someone connected with
lreland. If so, we find in this 889 about the earliest example of the amplifica-
tion which the words of Gildas underwent at the hands of latei· writers. Its
exaggeration raises the question whether persecution was possible in Britain,
inasmuch as it belonged to the part of the Empire assigned to Constantius, as
Caesar of the &Vest or Gaul. It has been held that Gildas is contradicted by
Eusebius and Lactantius, who are understood as asserting that Constantius
had no part in the persecution (Eus, H. E, viii, 13, 13: Visa Consl„ I, 3. 17:
