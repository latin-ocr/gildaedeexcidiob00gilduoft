Annals, in their records of the plagueS, compel us to choose one os
two dates : either the first hals of the sixth century, or the early
sixties of the seventh; 71107'lal2‘tas leuius armi agrees equally with
both ; and if we choose the earlier date, Gildas may have been the
author ; but if the later date be fixed upon, the concurrence of four
MSS. seems to ascribe the authorship to Laidcenn. Nevertheless‚
though certain definite characteristics ofthe Hymn are strongly sug-
gestive of a date later than 540-550, we may still maintain that the
1rish mention ofGildas implics a Wclsh origin ofthe Lom'ca, it being
probably the work of some Welsh monk or cleric.1 The earlier
date, as well as British authorship, is strongly supported—not to
mention other names—by Zimmer in Nennius Vindfcatus, the later
and probable Irish authorship, by Thurneysen in a review of that
book which appeared in Zeitsclzrfftfi'ir Deutsclze Plcilvlogie, Bd. 28,
5. 111. But now the investigation of this question involves the con-
sideration of documents not hitherto mentioned, of which I shall
give a brief account.

1. Between 1828 and 1838, Cardinal Mai published at Rome a number
of documents under the title A actores Classici( et Patres) e Vaticanis codd.
ed. (ten vols), in vol. v of which, pp. 479-500, there appears a short work
which bears the name Hz‘sper2·ca Famina. This production is now more
accessible in Migne’s P. L„ tome xe, 1186. It received closer notice and
investigation as to its character and origin in the Archiv. fiir lat. Lexico-
graphie, Bande ii, iii, iv, by Geyer, Thurneysen and Stowasser, and at great
length by Zimmer in the Appendix to Nenm'us Vindz'catus.2 Dr. Zimmer has
also treated of it in another contribution, to be noted underthe second head.

2. Mone, in 1851, printed certain glosses contained in the so-called
Luxemburg Fragment (MS. Luxemb„ 89) in his work Die Gallz'sclte
Spraclze und ilcre Brauchbarkeit; these have been printed and explained

 

¹ The close intercourse between &Vales and Ireland‚ of which we find ample
evidence in the early Vitae, is shown to be still maintained at the end of the
eleventh century, by the poem which was composed by Ieuan in honour of his
father Sulyen, Bishop of St. David’s, whose other son, Rychmarch, became also
Bishop of the same see (Bruts, p. 2933 G. Evans’s edition). Of Sulgenus the
son says :—-

“ Exemplo patrum, commotus [a]more legendi,
Ivit ad Hibernos sophia mirabile claros.”

“After the example of our fathers, drawn by love of reading,
He repaired to the Irish, renowned for their wondrous wisdom.''
Haddan and stubbs, Councils, i, p. 665.
