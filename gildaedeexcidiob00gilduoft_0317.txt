Tlae Lorica of Gz’ldas. 30 5

THE LORICA OF G1LDAs.

GILDAS composed this lorica to drive away those demons which attacked him.
To him an angel carne, and the angel said to him: If any man repeats that
lorica osten, there shall be added a seven years' portion to his life, and the third
part of his sins shall be blotted out. VVhatever day he recites this prayer . . . men
or demons, and enemies can do him no injury; death on that day touches
him not. Laidcend, son of Biiith the Victorious, came from him to the island of
lreland ; he brought over and carried it to be placed on the altar of St. Patrick,
bishop, to make us safe. Amen. The metre is of eleven syllables, which is also
called bracicatalecticmz, because it consists of eleven syllables; the scansion is so.

Help unity of trinity‚
have pity trinity of unity ;
Help me, I pray, thus placed
as in the peril of a great sea,
So that the plague of this year
draw me not with it, nor the vanity of the world.
And this very petition I make unto the high
powers of the heavenly warfare‚
that they leave me not to be harried by enemies,
but defend me with their strong armour ;
that, before me in the battle, go
those armies of the heavenly warfare,
Cherubim and Seraphim with their thousands,
Gabriel and Michael with like ones.

 

² The best account of the metre of this Hymn is found in lee lm'slz Liber
Hymnorum (H. Bradshaw Society)‚ vol. ii, p. xxi. Elision, as in other Latin
Hymns by Irish writers, is not observed, and quantity is often ignored. “The
metre is trochaic trimeter catalectic, and the formula is 2 (6 and 5). In every
pair oflines there is a cretic jingle of assonance (trisyllabic).’'

3 Milite: the metre requires militie ( =1m·litz·ae) as in N, K, C. These powers
are the nine grades of angelic powers : owing to the needs ofmetre they are
thrown out of the usual order (see p. 295). Readers of 'Welsh will be interested
to note how these appear in Llyvyr Agkyr: “Naw radd a ddyweit yr Ysgrythur
Lan y bot o'r egylyonn, nyt amgen : Engylyon, archegylyon, cadeiryeu
(thronau), arglwyddiaetheu, tywyssogaetlieU‚ meddyanneu, nerthoedd‚ cherubin,
seraphim* The Aramaic ending cherubin is observed in all the MSS. except
K, which has seraphim ; the Welsh gives the same.

⁴² Militie ; the rhyme acle: militie shows that both c and t have the sibilant
sound.
