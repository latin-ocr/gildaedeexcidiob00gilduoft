in pleasant situations adapted for superior cultivation, mountains
in the greatest convenience for changing pasture of cattle. The
flowers of divers colours on these, trodden by human footsteps,
gave them the appearance of a fine picture, like a chosen bridel

5 adorned with various jewels. It is irrigated by many clear springs,
with their full waters moving snow—white gravel, and by shining
rivers flowing with gentle murmur, extending to those who recline
on their banks a pledge of swect slumber, and by lakes overfiowing
with a cool stream of living water.

4 This island, of proud neck and mind, since it was first im]
habited, is ungratefully rebelling, now against God, at other times
against fellow citizens, sometimes even against the kings over the
sea and their subjectS. For what deeper baseneSS, what greater
unrighteousness‚ can be or be introduced by the recklessness of men,

15 than to deny to God sear, to worthy fellow citizens love, to those
placed in higher position the honour due to them, without detriment
to the saith—than to break saith with divine and human sentiment,
and having cast away sear of heaven and earth, to be governed by
one's own inventions and lusts ?

20 I, therefore, omit those ancient errors, common to all nations,
by which before the coming ofChrist in the flesh the whole human
race was being held in bondage; nor do Ι enumerate the truly
diabolical monstrosities of my native country, almost surpassing
those of Egypt in number, of which we behold some, of ugly

25 features, to this day within or without their deserted walls„ stiff with
fierce visage as was the custom. Neither do I, by name, inveigh
against the mountains, valleys or rivers, once destructive, but now
suitable for the use of man, upon which divine honour was then
heaped by the people in their blindness. I keep silence also as to

30 the long years of savage tyrants, who are spoken of in other far
distant countries, so that Porphyry, the rabid eastern dog in hostility

 

These limitations are instructive, inasmuch as they show how the narrative
itself is ruled by the spirit of the whole “ Epistle.⁷'

3 Porsenla. Vol. vii of Hubner’s Corpus lnscr. Lat. bears ample evidence
that the worship, eg„ of Mithra, had spread in Britain, the monuments ofwhich
were mainly erectecl by Roman officers Gildas in the word persensa seems to
refer to such remains of oriental cults. Cf. Jerome, Ep„ 107, 2 : nonne specum
Mithrae et omnia portentosa simulacra quibus Corax, Nymphus, Miles, Leo,
Perses, Helios, Dromo, Pater initiantur.

4 Porphyrius rabidus orientalis adversus ecclesiam canis. Porphyry (2 3 3-
304) is called orientalis as a Greek writer 3 besides other (philosophical) works
he wrote also a work in xv Rooks “Against the Christians‘'' (κατὰ xpm-rimabit).
