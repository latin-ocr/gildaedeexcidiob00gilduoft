fault with all brethren who have not, along with them, carried out
their inventions and presumptions. These, whilst they eat bread

use water, they drink at the same time of the cup of hatred: they
take their enjoyment simultaneously of dry dishes and back—biting;

contempt, at the time when they are musing on their leading
principles; they prefer servants to lords, the common herd to
kings, lead to gold, iron to silver, the prop (to the vine). In this
