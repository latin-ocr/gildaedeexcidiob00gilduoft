not the praises of God, in the tuneful voice of Christ's followers,
with its sweet rhythm, and the song of church melody, that are
heard, but thine own praises (which are nothing) ; the voice of the
rascally crew yelling forth, like Bacchanalian revellerS, full of lies

this way the vessel, once prepared for the service of God, is changed
into an instrument of Satan, and that which was deemcd worthy
of heavenly honour is, according to its desert, cast into the abyss

the extreme excess of thy sacrilegious deed, from lowest crimes to
still lower. Afterwards thou didst wed her, by whose collusion

² Zabuli. This form, zabulus for diabolus, is frequently found even as
early as the Pseudo-Cypriam, De Alealor. 5-7. Instances are given in Ronsch's
[lala und Vulgata, and in Koffmanne's Gesclz. des K z'rchenlaleim‚ from Com-
modian, Lactantius, and Ambrose. But the form is specially characteristic of
Irish and Welsh writers, occurring even in Biblical texts, e.g.‚ lf'ersz'o Ante-
Hz'eromtm'ana, edited by Dr. Abbot‚ cf. Pracfiztlb, p. xxi. St. Sechnall's
Hymn, v, 84 has it—

“quos redemit hominum
innumeros de zabuli obsoluet dominio.⁷'

Even zacones=diaconi‚ occurs in Commodian, lustr„ ii, 26, 1, and in inscrip-
