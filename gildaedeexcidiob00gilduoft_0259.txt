108 Why ply more words? You find brought before you the
example of Matthias for your confusion, the example also of the
holy apostles. The lot fell upon him by the electior] or judg-
ment of Christ, not by his own will, to which fact you have

5become blind, and do not see how far apart you are from his
merits, while of your own accord you siml< to the desire and dispo-
sition of Judas the traitor. It 15 plain, therefore, that the man
who consciously from his heart calls you priest, is not an excellent
Christian. Ι shall certainly speak out my feelings. My rebuke
10 might certainly be milder, but what benefit is it merely to stroke
sostly with the hand, or besmcar with ointment a wound which by
now, horrible in its foulness, has need of cautery and 1116 public
remedy of fire? If, indeed, it could be healed in any manner, as
the patient does not seek cure, and the doctor 15 withdrawing
15 further and further from him. O ye enemies and not priests of
God, veterans in wickednesses and not bishops‚ traitors not suc-
cessors of the holy apostles and not ministers of Christ, you have
certainly listened to the sound of the apostle Paul's words contained
in the second lesson, but in no wise have you observed their
20 admonitions and strength. After the fashion of idols, which see
not, neither do they hear, you stood the same day 31 1116 31131,

good work. You seek the office of bishop chiefly because of
covetousness, without the pretence of spiritual profit, and by no
means regard good work 35 5111131116 11161610. Εῑιείι a man 712ust1Yi112·iii 2·
therefore be without reproach. Here there is, of a truth, more need
30 of tears than of words, as if the apostle had said that he ought to
be, beyond all men, without reproach: The husband of one zerifi‘.
This saying is also so far despised with us, 35 if he were not heard
to say the same, and were heard to say: tlze husband of wives
