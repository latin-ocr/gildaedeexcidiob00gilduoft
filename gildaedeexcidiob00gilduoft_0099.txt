37 Here indeed, or even before, was to be concluded this tearful
and complaining story of the evils of this age, so that my mouth
should no further relate the deeds of men. But let them not
suppose that I am timid or wearied, 50 as not to be carefully on
my guard against that saying of lsaiah : l'Voe nuto him rullo calletlz lsaialz v, 20.

figure and reality. Owing, probably, to this difficulty, the copyist 01 Codex A
has omitted all reference to “homes'' and Pharaoh. It reads : libet itaque edicere
quid quantumque minarum inclamitent prophetica oracula llis supra dictis
