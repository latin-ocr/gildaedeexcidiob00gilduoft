One objection occurs to anyone that has read the Life somewhat
carefully3 here we read chncarbfmenszk, but in the Vita itself
Nancarbanenszk ecclesia (ce. 7, 8), Carbcme valle (c. 6), Carbanam
vallem (c. 9), which might serve as an argument that the verses
were added by a copyist. As this point will be discussed presently‚
it is sufficient to state here that the two names may, on good
groundS, be regarded as used contemporaneously. But, further,
the verses are found, as was said, in the oldest MS, that of C C C,
Cambridge, and also in a copy of that Burney MS. 310, which
Stevenson made the basis of his text. As they distinctly assign
the authorship to caradoc, there seems no good reason for doubt
upon the very slight internal grounds advanced by Stevenson.

Of Caradoc it is but little that is known with any certainty;
he is regarded as' the author of certain Ανωῑαίς, or Brut, giving an
account of British princes from the time of Cadwaladr, with whom
Geoffrey of Monmouth finishes his work. Of this supposed Brut,
carried down to the year 1270, there existed about 1559 “a hundred
copies at the least, whereof the most part were written two
hundred yeares ago. This booke Humffrey Lhoyd, gentleman (a
paineful and a worthie searcher of Brytish antiquities) translated
into English, and partlie augmented, chieflie out of Matthew Paris,
and Nicholas Triuet.‘' So writes Dr. David Powel, who, in 1584,
published The Historia of cambria from the MS. of Humphrey
Lloyd : “the translation of H. Lhoyd,'' he adds further on, “ I have
conferred with the Brytish booke, whereof Ι had two ancient
copies, and corrected the same, when there was cause so to doo.''
This work, often reprinted, purports to be a Hislorie⁷ based upon
the work of Caradoc, who “collected the successions and actes of
the Brytish Princes after Cadwalader, to the yeare of Christ 1156.'’
Ussher makes frequent mention of the Cleronz‘con of Caradoc. A
Brut, which in its title purports to bc compiled by Caradoc, may be
read in the sllyryrimz Arclcaiolog s (p. 385, second edition 3 cf. p. 601),
but it is difficult to believe that this “Gwentian Brut,’' as it is
styled by Mr. Aneurin Owen, can be in any way connected with
the monl< os Llangarfan, except as being based upon some Latin
Chroniclc or Annals of Princes that he had written, but is now
lost. This surmise seems to bc rendered more than probable by
