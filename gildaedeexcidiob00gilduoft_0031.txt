my ability‚ not so much by the aid of native writings or records of
authors, inasmuch as these (if they ever existed) have been burnt
by the fires of enemieS, or carried far away in the ships which
exiled my countrymen, and so are not at hand, but shall follow the

10 account of foreign writers, which, because broken by many gaps, is
far from clear.

5 The Emperors of Rome acquired the empire of the world, and,
by the subjugation of all neighbouring countries and islands
towards the east, secured through the might of their superior

15 fame their first peace with the Parthians on the borders os India.
When this peace was accomplished, wars ceased at that time in
almost every land. The keenness of this flame, however, in its
persistent career towards the west, could not be checked or
extinguished by the blue tide of the sea; crossing the channel

20 it carried to the island laws for obedience without oppositi0n;
it subjugated an unwarlike but faithless people (not so much as
in the case of other nations by sword, fire, and engines, as by
mere threats or menaces of judgments) who gave to the edicts
merely a skin-deep obedience, with resentment sunl< deep into

1 The first Parthian peace. There appears to be some confusion in the mind
of Gildas here: the passage will bear a good meaning, if understood of the
peace made shortly after the death of Trajan, ΑΒ. 117; therefore the expe-
dition to Britain mentioned by Gildas here is that under Hadrian, who in
A.D. 122 built the great wall called after him. Why does Gildas select this
particular time ? The answer may be found in the word ‘⁶ unfaithful 3⁷² after the
great advances and improvements made under Agricola (78-85), which, no
doubt, ceased not with his abrupt departure, the Britons soon show themselves
restless under Roman rule. This, to the mind of Gildas, proved them to be an
“unfaithful people.'' and the record of their swift subjection under such a
character serves well the special purpose of his work. See Additional Note, c. 18.
