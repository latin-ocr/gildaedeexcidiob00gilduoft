T he Life of Gildas. 379

scontinued making excuseS, and saying that he could in no way
do so, the abbot who, as we have said, was also a bishop, seized
him and led him to the altar, and on the 4th day of July preferred
him to the office of an abbot. Therefore‚ when Felix, now an
abbot, had received the blessing both of his own abbot and of his
10 congregation, he returned, bringing with him letters of recommen-
dation to the princes of Britanny and to the bishop of Vannes.
As he was hesitating which of two places was preferable to fix
upon as the seat for his abbey, he consulted Duke Alain and the
bishop of Vannes upon this matter. After calling together the
Ῑ5 nobleS, and some bishops also, they fixed upon the monastery of
St. GildaS, which was older, and owing to the fertility of the soil,
was richer in corn and wine and fruit-bearing trees, and was like-
wise most abounding in season in various kinds of large fish.
39 Now, there was in that neighbourhood, at that time, a certain
20 servant of God, of the name of Ehoarn, who was leading 3 solitary
life. One night robbers rushed in upon him, and dragged him
from his house which adjoined the church. One ofthem, Leopardus
by name, seized an axe, and dashed out the man's brain upon the
threshold of the church. He was at once seized by an evil spirit,
25 and fell to the ground. When he rose up, he took a knife and
wounded himself in his breast; and had he not been speedily
prevented by his comrades, he would have killed himself. He
was, therefore, bound by them, and returned home, but he never
afterwards recovered his senses. For we saw him through the
30 course of twenty yearS, clothed with no garments—without a tunic,
shirt, or shoes—but in a strange manner walking about naked,
both in summer and winter. If any one, out of pity, offered him
some garment‚ he, if he had chanced to sit down under a tree, or
indeed in any place whatever, would not depart until he had torn
35 that garment to shreds. If it had been a woollen or a linen
garment‚ he would pull it to pieceS, thread by thread, upon the
spot3 but if one made of skins, he would cut it up to nothing.
And so walking about naked sor many yearS, he endured at home
and abroad the intense heat of summer and the intolerable cold of
40 winter. Oh! the unspeakable mercy of Christ! Oh! the immensity
of His goodness and His compassion! Oh! the glorious merits
of St. Gildas! merits which thus, in one and the same man, both
