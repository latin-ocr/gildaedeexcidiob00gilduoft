lee Lz'fe of Gildas. 345

anyone ask tlzee who made tlcee whole, tell llzcm, it was the
Lora' Jesus Christ, tlzrouglz the merz‘ts of His apostles, tlzat shewed
His mercy unte me. Forthwith the sick man was made whole,
and entered the basilica of the apostle Peter, praising and magni-
5fying God. St. Gildas, however, proceeded on the journey he
had begun; and while tarrying there for a few days visiting the
oratories of the saints, he heard that the citizens of Rome were
being grievously afflicted owing to the noxious breath of a
dragon which was hiding in a cavern in some mountain, and
ιο which, by its pestiferous breath, had killed many of the Romans
and os others dwelling in the neighbourhood. Hearing this, St.
Gildas, at an early hour in the morning, went out secretly from
his inn, and ascended the mountain, bearing a staff in his hand.
After offering up a prayer, he came to the mouth of the cave;

15 and, seeing the dragon, he called upon the name of Christ, and
said fearlessly: [γε tlze name os our Lordsesus Christ, l bid tlcee
die at once, tlzat tlze people os belz'evers may be no more destroyed
by tlzee. All at once it sank down to the ground ancl died, and
its plague ceased from among the people.

14 Then St. GildaS, to benefit by the prayer of St. Apollinaris,
departed for Ravenna. As he was approaching the gate of the
city, there met him a blind and dumb man, whom a man was
leading about by the hand, while he himself was beating a board
with a hammer, for a sign that he was asking alms. On seeing

25 him, St. Gildas was moved with pity‚ and began to weep; and,
requesting that water should be brought to him, he blessed it and
sprinkled it on the blind man's face. And so, by the favour of
God, he received his sight. Then, taking some salt, he similarly
blessed it, and applied it to the man's mouth. Straightway he

30 spoke also, blessing God and magnifying the blessed man who
had conferred such great health upon him.

15 Now it came to pass that, when he was returning thence, he
happened to fall among thieves. Seeing him shining by the
splendour of his handsome person, some tried to capture him,

35 others to kill him. When he saw them approaching him, he
called upon the name of Christ; and forthwith, with the assent
of God, he caused their feet to stick to the ground, and them-
selves to become stiff as stones. He then withdrew from them,
and proceeded on the way he had begun. But, when he had gonea

40 considerable distance from them, he turned back, lifted up his
hand, and released them. When they were released, they took to
flight, and after that injured no man in those districts.
