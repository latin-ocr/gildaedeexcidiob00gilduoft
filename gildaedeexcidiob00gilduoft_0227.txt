92 But let these few testimonies from the many of the prophets
be sufficient. By them is the pride or sloth of stubborn priests
10 restrained, that they may not think I make such denunciations
against them by my own imaginings rather than by the authority of
the law and the saints. Let us therefore see what the gospel
trumpet, while sounding forth to the world, says to irregular priests
(unordained priests). For as I have already said, my speech is not
15 ofthose who obtain the apostolic throne in a lawful way, and who are
well able to dispense spiritual food to their fellow servants in clue
season (if, in fact, there are many at the present day), but of the
unskilled pastors who abandon the sheep, and give vain things as
food, and have not the words of the skilled pastor. The evidence,
20 therefore, is clear, that he is not a legitimate pastor ; nay, not even
an ordinary Christian man, who rejects and disowns these words,
not so much words of mine, who arn very insignificant, as decrees
of the Old and New Testament. One of our own people says
well: We desire muesz [leat ille enemies of tlze clznrcli be onrs also

application of aposloliecz sedes by him to the see of any bishop, is in no way
singular. See Thomassinus, Vetus et Nova Eccl. Disezjol„ Pt. I, Lib. Ι, 4,
where many more instances may be found. We do not forget‚ that by the
beginning of the sixth century, the two terms papa and aposloliccz sedes were
very generally used exclusively of the Roman bishop and church; and long
before that by individual writers, such as the great Popes themselves, the
author or compiler of the Liber Pontz'ficalz's, etc.

4 Conservis suis in tempore cibaria. Here again Gildas is found unconsciously
falling to the use of the Old Latin Scriptural phraseology of his own earlier
days. Had he the Vulgate in mind, he would have said : fiznziliae suae in lenz-
pore tritici mensnram, with no mention of conservis snis. The Latin version of
Iremreus, iv, 26, 5, which may be as old as Tertullian, that is about A.D. 200,
has preserved the passage almost as quoted by Gildas‚ (ια’ damiani ess cibario in
tempore. Codex e of the Old Latin (fourth century> reads cibaria conservis
suis, and Origen had τοῖς συνδούλοις in his text.

Gildas may have read in his codex : ut largiatur conservis suis in
tempore cibaria. ’
