¹ Superbo {ju-auno. VThe native king is calleci tyrannus, because the sole
legitimate authority, that of Rome, was absent. Procopius, who was a younger
contemporary of Gilclas, relates that aster the death of the tyrant Constantine
(AJ). 4111, ‘⁸ the Romans were no longer able to save Britain, but it remained
from his time continuously under tyrants’⁷ (ἀλλ’ οὖσα ὑπὸ τυράννοις ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ
ἔμενεν), Codex A reads &smmum Uorlzgeruo, and X &ranno Gurtlugeruo
Bm'luuuarusu duce (giving thus its later sorln to the name, in the same way as
Guenedotia takes the place of Venedoffia), and the words of course appear in
Cale’s edition based on the latter MS. The name may have slipped into MSS.
of Gildas from the Historia Brt’louum of Nennius, or perhaps from Beda
(H. E„ i, 1421, who writes, placitisque omuibus cum rege suo Uortzjgemzo, and in
the Cluvuz‘rle, Verugremo. Nearly all the MSS. of Nennius have the late form,
(mm-thigernus, which in Wetsh becomes Gwrlheyru. That Gildas is not
ignorant of the former predatory visits of the Saxons (as attested by Ammianus
Marcellinus, and by the early title “ Count ofthe Saxon shore’⁷>, is evident from
the words, “whom in their absence they feared more than death.’' Men are
1101 feared in their absence except through previous unhappy acquaintance, so
that the 111110115 1111151 have had experience of the hated Saxons at times
anteiior to this eompact struck with them. The same conclusion may also
be drawn from the clo-sing sentence osc. 18 : “They build towers on the south
coast where ships were usually anchored because from fleat qum-ter alsa wild
beusts of Μαι-1111110115 were to be fearedss' These could be no other than the
&ax-ons. Zinnner appears to 1ne entirely wrong in concluding that 111-111511
tradition, s. 540, knew nothing os a previous presence os the Saxons in Britain :
“von einer fruheren anwesenheit derselben 111 111-1110111011 weiss sie absolut
nicht& (Xz'uusus lssndz‘v„ 100).
