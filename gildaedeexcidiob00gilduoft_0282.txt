XI. ROMANI DICUNT:1 Brittonum tonsura a Simone mago
sumpsisse exordium tradunt, cuius tonsura de aure ad aurem

tantum contingebat pro excellentia ipsa magorum tonsurae, qua
sola frons anterior tegi solebat. Priorem autem auctorem huius

tonsurae in Hibernia subulcum2 regis Loigairi filii Neili extitisse 5
Patricii sermo testatur: ex quo Hibernenses paene omnes hanc
tonsuram sumpserunt.

one Church, the British from Simon Magus, and a symbol of schism, will be
found in the letter of Aldhelm referred to above, and in the interesting letter of
Abbot Ceolfrid to Naibron, King of the Pius, reproduced at length in Beda's
Hislory, v, 41 (p. 342 in Plummer’s edition).

3. Celebration of Easter : the third point of difference, though not actually
mentioned here, may, notwithstanding, be the real implication of the reference
to Jews <cum ludaeis). WVhen the fourteenth day of the vernal moon fell upon
a Sunday, the Roman and Eastern Churches celebrated Easter upon the
following Sunday, in order to avoid holding the feast on the same day as the
Jews: the Celts‚ however, following a more ancient usage, observed their
Easter even on the fourteenth moon, provided it were the Sunday‚ and so
appeared to act “with the Jews’⁷ (Beda, H.E., ii, 2 ; v, 21). One inconvenient
result, in practical life, of this difference, is pointed out by Beda; that is to say,
two neighbouring churches might be engaged at the same time, the one in the
glad joyous services of Eastertide‚ the other in the severe exercise of Lenten
fasts.

4. Mode of “completing'' baptism : this fourth point we find advanced by
Augustine in his conference with the British bishops: one of his three final
demands was, that they should complete the ministry of baptism according to
the usage of the Holy Roman and Apostolic Church (ut ministerium baptizandi
juxta morem sanctae Romanae et apostolicae ecclesiae compleatis). On the
meaning of this compleatis one may adduce the following facts among others
In the Lzfl’ ofSt. Brzgrtd we read of a vision where two priests anoint the head
of a girl, “contpletz'ng the order of baptism in the usual way” (ordinem baptismi
complentes consueto more) ; the Stowe Missa! prescribes the anointing on the
forehead (in cerebrum in fronte> with chrism, to be performed by a presbyter τ
St. Bernard, in his Life osSt. Malae-lli, mentions the (to his mind> absence of
the rite of confirmation in Ireland, and (as understood by him> its restoration
through St. Malachi as one of the consuetudines sanciae Romanae efflesiae
(Opp, tom. i, 1473). Irish and British thus seem to have preserved an older
