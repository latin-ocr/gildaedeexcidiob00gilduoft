APPENDICES.

ΑΝ attempt is made in the Introduction to give an account of the
pieces printed in the three following appendices—This contains (a)
the history of the FragmentS, which are here printed from the text
found in Haddan and Stubbs’ Councils, i, 108, and Wasserschleben's
Im‘sclle Kanonensczmmllmg, 2nd edition, 1885; (b) a survey os the
place occupied by penitentials, as to origin and purpose, in the life
of the Western Church, and their probable rise among the Churches
of Britain and Ireland; (c) a comparison of other ancient Loricae
with the one that has been preserved bearing the name of Gssdas,
together with a statement of grounds upon which its authority has
been favourably maintained.

APPENDIX A.

THE text printed here is that found in Haddan and Stubbs'
Comzcz'ls, i, 108, which is based upon a MS. preserved at Corpus
Christi College, Cambridge, written in the ninth or tenth
century. The second part of the MS. (pp. 11-109) contains a
collection of Canons, consisting chiefly of extracts from the
writings of the leading ancient church writers, but among thern
extracts from writings of Patricius and Gz'ldas. These latter are
introduced by the simple praefatory note, dicit Gz'ldas or Gz'ldas
ait. But the same words of Gildas, though in briefer compass, are
also found in a collection of Irish CanonS, made at the end of the
seventh or beginning of the eighth century, consisting of sixty-
two Books with capitula or sub-sections, which Wasserschleben
has twice edited. I use the second edition (1885). We shall call the
Cambridge and the Irish collections C. and H. respectively. Now
it may be gathered that the compiler of these Irish canons, about
ΑΒ. 700, and the writer of the Cambridge MS„ about ΑΒ. 900, had
both used an older collection first made in Ireland. At that time
certain writings of Gildas, besides the De Excidio, were well known
among the Irish, and, presumably, among his own countrymen.
From H. we have the title affixed to three, Gildas in lzis letters
