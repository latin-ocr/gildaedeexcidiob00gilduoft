pin-port as a Christian moralist. We may ‘regard it as extremely
probable that this is the very work to whlch Columbanus refers,

when writing shortly after Α.1). 595.

2. Α series of FRAGMENTS. These Fragments appear in a col-
lection of 111105 01· canons sor church order, belonging to the early
lrish Church. The whole consists of LXVII books, divided into
chapter*⁸ which give extracts from many ecclesiastica] writers ; eg.
(bvgcuvs, llicrombnm, Augustinus, Gregorius, Isidorus, also Sinodus
Hibernensis, &e Among these appear extracts made probably
from letters, now lost, of Gildas‚ such as that mentioned by
Columbanus as written to Finian. These will be printed from the
text of XVasserschleben's [rische Kanonensammlung, 2nd edition

(Leipzig, 1885).

3. An early Penstential, or DE PAENITENTIA. This will be
printed from the text of wasserscl-ileben's Bussordnungen (Halle,
1851), and Haddan and stubbs, Conncz'ls, vol. i, p. 113 (1869).
I‘cnitentials, especially as found in the Celtic remains, show the
gradual extension of disciplinary rules over the life, chiefly of
monks, but also of those living outside the cloisters‚ in that age.

4. The LORICA GILDAE. After much deliberation, it has been
thought better to include this poem as a probably genuine pro-
duction of Gildas. 'she text will be that printed in THE IRISH
LIBER HYMNORUM, published by the Henry Bradshaw society,
1897 (ml. i, p. 206), compared with that of Zimmer in sisennius
l'inclic·al2(s.· ‘⁴ Die Lorz'ca des Gildas,” 5. 337.

The necessary documentary research by examination of the
few codices remaining. and of probable evidence as to lost ones, in
the first editions professedly based upon them, has been already
accomplished for us by the edition of Gildas which has appeared in
the MONUMENTA GERMANIAE HISTORICA, forming vol. iii of the
·“ Chronica Minora Sacc. iv, v, vi, vii, edidit Theodorus llffommseffl’
( 1894-1898). It may well be presumed that no fresh research could
have provided us with a text of Gildas accompanied with the
same guarantce of thoroughness as this edition by Dr. Mommsen.
