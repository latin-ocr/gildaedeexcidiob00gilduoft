extracts as these. The whole perspective is changed. Further, if
Finnian, the founder of Clonard, died about 549, then it is natural
that we should find Gildas' correspondent in the later Finnian of
Moville. One is almost tempted to seek the sources of some of
these extracts in writings of a different kind : there were published
at Louvain, in 1667, a collection of the writings of Columbanus
made some five years previously by Fleming‚ and these contain
short sermons or addresses to monks, called Instructiones. They
have been lately edited separately by Seebass, in the Zez‘tsclzrz'ft
fiir Kirclcengescllz'cllle‚ xiv, 76-92. We know how faithfully Colum-
banus clung in Gaul to the usages of his native Ireland; so that
in these very lustrationes, we may discern a usage which originally
carne from Wales, whence the newer monastic institutions of
Ireland had been, directly or indirectly, inspired. Such addresses
by Gildas, if preserved might furnish matter for quotation to a
writer who was drawing up a collection of Canons.

One is particularly impressed by two features in these extracts.
In the first place, there breathes through all a strong spirit of
moderatiori that is quite unlike the character in which Gildas has
been clothed by the imagination of many writers; in the second
place, they show that Monasticism and the Church, in its regular
organization‚ are drawing closer together than could have been the
case at the time when Gildas wrote his indignant appeal to bishops,
and to clergy generally, in the De Excidio.
