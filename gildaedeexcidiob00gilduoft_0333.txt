Vita Gz'la'ae. 32 1

fimctz‘mz holds no promineat place. Scraps of old stories are worked
in, such as that of the bell, but Illtud’s rude Celtic establishment
of the early sixth century is transformed into the fashion of a
Benedictine or Cistercian abbey.

It would be well to marl< this trait, so prominent in the Breton
Limes. with their background of early close intimacy with XVales,
but altogether absent in many of the British, and without real
significance in any. It is Illtud the teacher‚ we find in traditions
preserved by Breton writers; the Welsh biographer of St. David
did not know him. the Welsh biographer of Gildas also knew
him not.

It has been well said that Western monasticism was aristocratic ;
the British “saints'' or, to use a more appropriate term, monks,
whose Lz‘ves have been written are in the same way, as a rule, sons
of kings or princes, or some highly exalted personages. Now we
observe further, in looking through the &Velsh Vitae, and the
notices generally, that Arthur is a prominent figure in almost all:
many of the Welsh saints, according to these accounts, are closely
related to him. He figures in Caradoc’s Life os Gildas, in the
Lz'ves of Cadoc and of Illtud, though the Book· of Llanddv is silent
about him. But it is impossible to follow Mr. Skene when he
speaks in reference to Gildas, of “Acts compiled subsequent to
the appearance of Geoffrey of Monmouth's history'' (Celtic Scot-
land, i, 116, 117 note), because the Arthur found in the writings
named is in no way the Arthur made glorious by Geoffrey. In
these he is not great, he is often mean ; and the idea presented of
him, while it witnesses to the pre-eminence which he was attaining
in the minds of Weish writers, is undoubtedly older than that
created by the author of the Historia Regum Britanniae. But
here again, when we turn to the Breton Vitae, our Arthur is
entirely absent. In such a fact we cannot but argue a higher
antiquity, and, as far as they gO, more reliable traditions. This
conclusion Ι apply, in this place more particularly, to the Life of
Gz‘ldas that appears in our pages as Vita l.
