34 Χνὴεη the dream of thy oppressive reign turned out according
5 to thy wish, didst thou not, drawn by the desire to return unto the
right way, with the consciousness of thy sins probably biting days
and nights during that period, first, largely meditating with thy-
self on the godly walk and the rules of monks, then, bringing
them sorward to the knowledge of open publicity, didst thou not
10 vow thyself for ever a monk? without any thought of unfaith-
fulness was it done, according to thy declaration, in the sight of
God Almighty, before the face of angels and men. Thou hadst
broken, as was thought, those big nets, by which sat bulls of thy class
are wont to be entangled headlong, that is, thou hadst broken the
13nets of every kind of royalty‚ of gold and of silver, and what
is mightier than these, of thine own imperious will. And thy-
self didst thou profitably snatch like a dove, from the raven,
strongly cleaving the thin air in rustling flight, escaping the cruel
claws os the speedy hawk with sinuous windings, to the caves of
20 the saints, sure retreats for thee, and places os refreshment. What
gladness would there be for thy mother, the church, if the enemy
of all mankind had not disastrously dragged thee off, in a way, from
her bosom! What plentiful touchwood sor heavenly hope would
blaze in the hearts of men without hope, if thou didst persevere in
25 good! What and how many rewards of the kingdom of Christ
would wait thy soul in the day ofjudgment, if that crafty wolf,
when from a wolf thou hadst become a lamb, had not snatched
thee from the Lord's fold (not greatly against thy will), to make
thee a wolf from a lamb, like unto himself! W'hatjoy thy salvation‚
30 if secured, had furnished to the gracious Father and God of all
saints, had not the wretched father of all the lost, like an eagle of
mighty wings and claws——the devil, I mean—against every right,
snatched thee away to the unhappy troop of his children !
Not to be tedious—thy conversion unto good fruit brought as
35 much joy and pleasantneSS, both to heaven and earth, as now thy
accursed reversion to thy fearful vomit like a sick dog, has caused
