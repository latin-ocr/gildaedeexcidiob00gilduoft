T lie chz'n of Britain. I 5

3T11E island of Britain is situated in almost the furthest limit
of the world, towards the north-west and west, poised in the

so-called divine balance which holds the whole earth. It lies some· ,μ
what in the directior] of the north pole from the south-west. It is

5 800 miles long, 200 broad, not counting the longer tracts of sundry
promontories which are encompassed by the curved bays of the
sea. It is protected by the wide, and ifI may so say, impassable
circle of the sea on all sides, with the exception of the straits on
the south coast where ships sail to Belgic Gaul. It has the advan-

10 tage of the estuaries of two noble rivers, the Thames and the Severn,
arms, as it were, along which, of old, foreign luxuries were wont
to be carried by ships, and of other smaller streams ; it is beautified
by 28 cities, and some strongholdS, and by great works built in an
unexceptionable manner, walls, serrated towers, gates, houses, the

15 roofs of which, stretching alost with threatening height, were firmly
fixed in strong structure. It is adorned by widespread plains, hills

 

other sources, it may be concluded that besides the great military posts the
civil development of Britain was somewhat insignificant. Gildas informs us
that the wall (of Hadrian) ran ‘⁶ between cities'’ (inter urbes, quae ibidem forle
ob melum hostium collocatae juerant). There were no doubt garrison towns
where the auxiliary cohorts were stationed : there were also, Eburacum, where
the VIth legion was fixed3 Deva, with the XXth; and Isca, with the IInd
Augusta. Besides these military stations, though Gildas speaks of czmclae
coloniae and coloni in c. 24, not more than four are known that were, strictly
speaking, coloniae, viz„ Eburacum, Camulodunum, Glevum, Lindum. Many
small towns are named, especially towards the south and south-east3 but
Wales, in Hubner's map of places yielding inscriptions, is almost a blank.
The single mzmiczjbimn known, Verulamium, is accidentally mentioned by
GildaS, as well as Caerlleon (i.e., Caer legion= Legionum urbs). The Historia
Britomcm gives a list of these twenty-eight, which Zimmer argues must have
been drawn up some time before A.D. 796 (Nennius, Vindicatzcs, pp. 108-110).
He notices the intervocalic “g'’ in Cair Legion, Cair Segeint, Cair Guorthigirn.
