The Life of Gildas. 369

gave up the ghost on the 29th ofJanuary, an old man and full of
days, And his disciples bore his body away, and did as he had
directed them. But those who had come from Cornugallia, and
who were the majority, tried to carry him away and bring him

5 over to their own country. While, therefore, they were consulting

31

together and were arranging to do so, the ship, by God’s command,
sank with the holy body into the depth of the sea. They searched,
however, for it in different places for many days; but, as they
could in no way find it, they returned to their own.

His disciples also, who were from the monastery of Reuvisium,
having themselves too, for the space of three months, failed to
find him, took counsel at last, and determined to make a three
days' fast. When this was ended, it was revealed to one of them
when and where he was to be found. When, therefore, the Roga-

15 tion days were come, and the men had come to pray to a small

oratory which the saint had built in honour of the holy cross, they
found the ship in a creek which is called Croes-dy, that is, the
house osthe holy crOSS, with the holy body in it, whole and unharmed,
just as it was when placed in the ship by them themselves, On

20 seeing it, they rejoiced with great joy, and placed the stone for a

 

in the departed saint than those disciples from Cornouailles, waited three months
and then fasted three days. On the expiration of this fast, the time and place
of finding the body was revealed to one of them. The time came during
the Rogation days, when they had met for prayer in a small oratory. Our
biographer, with further detail, expresses the belief of his time that this day was
the 11th of May <quinto idus lllczz'z‘) ; it is quite legitimate for us to put aside the
miraculous threads os this story, woven into it by the pious imagination of a
wonder-loving generation, and at the same time to regard the 11th of May as a
reliable date for the removal of the body of Gildas to rest in his own church at
Ruys. It is quite probable that the Rogation days, as days of fast and prayer,
were commonly observed in Britanny‚ as in other places, after the Council of
Orange in 511 ; these were the three days, Monday, Tuesday, and XVednesday,
before Ascension Day. ssut in the year 570, the year of Gildas⁷ death accord-
ing to the Annales Cambriae, May 11th is a Sunday, which is not one of the
Rogation days, though sometimes called Rogation Sunday. Mr. Anscombe,
using these details, arrives at the conclusion that the finding of the body, and
so the death on January zoth, must be placed in the year 554. On other
grounds this seems far too early a date.

4 Croest(z‘). A Bosco and all editors print Eroerst, but, with the added
explanation, that the name means “house of the cross²⁷, the first part can be
no other than Croes: crux takes this form in both Breton and Welsh. The
latter part of the compound, surely, ought to be -ti (for mg), which is now sy,
meaning ‘⁶ house.⁷' The modern VVelsh would be eroes-dy.
