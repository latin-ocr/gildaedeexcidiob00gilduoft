55 But hear also what threats the distinguished prophet Zephaniah
heaps up: The great day of the Lord is near, near and hastem‘ng Zegffl- i. 14:
5 greatly. The voice of the day of the Lord hath heeh appointed hitter U’ 1'
aad vnghty, that day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulatioh aud dis-
tress, a day of cloud and mist, a day of trampet and ay, a day of misely
and desolation, a day of darkness and thick gloom, over strong eities and
hzgh corner towers. A nd l will distress meu, and they shall go as
10 blind, because they have simzed against the Lord,· and l will pour
out their blood as dnst, and their flesh as the dtcngof oxea ‚· and their
silver and gold cannot deliver them in the day of the Lord's anger.
And by the fire of his jealousy shall the whole land‘he constituted,
when the Lord shall bring ah end and a loaeliness over all that dwell
15 in the land. Come together, and gather yourselves together, natiou
without disciplina· before ye be made as a flower that passeth away,
before the anger of the Lord come upon you.
56 Listen also what Haggai, the holy prophet, says: Thus saith
the Lord .· Once shall I move heaven and earth and sea and chy Hag. ii, 22›23·

kings of the nations, and tarn away the chariots aad those (them)
that mount thereon.
57 Now again⁷ observe what Zachariah, son of Adda, the chosen
prophet, has said, beginning his prophecy in this manner: Retarn Zech- 12314·
25 unto me and J will return anto you, saith the Lord, aad be not such
as your fathers, whom the former prophets charged, saying, Tlms
saith the Lord Alnghty .· Retmn ye from your ways .· aad they did
not observe so as to hearhen anto me. Below also: And the angel Zeclz. v, ²¹ 3¹4·
said anto me, W hat seest thou P aad l said, I see a flying scythe (ff

 

Vulgate‚ Addo must have been his grandfather. The question, as a point of
history, does not concern us. But there is a reading of the Vulgate‚filimlz
Baraehiaefilium Addo, reproduced by Jerorne in his Commentary, which is in
evident agreement With the LXX: Ζαχαρίαν τὸν τοῦ Βαραχίου υἱὸν Ἀδδὼ τὸν
προφήτην. Gildas is therefore correctly following the tradition contained in the
codices of his time. The two, Haggai and Zechariah, go together in all lists of
the twelve minor prophetS, as in Gildas: unde recte juxta ordinem duodecim
prophetarum, ille decimus et hic undecimus ponitur (Jer.‚ Comm., i).

The epithet electus, which Gildas adds, instead of beatus, or sanctus, as in the
case of the other prophets, may be explained by the distinguished position
assigned to Zechariah, along with Haggai and Malachi, as members of the

“ Great Synagogue,'' in Jewish tradition, traditions well-known to Latin writers.
