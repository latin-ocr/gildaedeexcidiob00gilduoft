The Ruin of Britain. 21 1

point of history—of life andpeace ,· I gave hini sear and he feared
me, and stood in awe before my name. T he law os truth was in his
mouth and iniquity was not found in his lios ,· in peace and equity
walked he with nze, and did turn many from iniquity. For the
5 priest‘s lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at his
mouth, because he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts. Now he
changes his meaning, and ceases not to rebuke the evil ones,
saying : Y e have departed out of the way 3 ye have caused many to Mal. ii, 8-10.
stumble in the law, and ye have made the covenant with Levi of no
10 effect, saith the Lord of hosts. lsVheresore l have also made you cou-
temptible and base before all the people‚ according as ye have not kept
my ways, and have had respect [ff person iu the law. Have we not
all one father? Hath not one God created us Ρ Why doth every
one despise his brother ? Again : Behold the Lord of hosts will come, Mal. iii, 1·3-
15 and who can think of the day os his coming J? And who shall stand
to see him P For he himself shall come forth like buruingfire, and as
the washers' soap‚ and he shall sit refining and purifying silver, and
he shall purge the sons os Levi, and shall cleause them like gold and
like silver. After a while : Your words have become strong against Mal. iii, 13·15·
20 me, saith the Lord, and ye said: V ain is he that serveth God, and
what profit is it that we have kept his precepts‚ and that we
have walked niournfully before the Lord of hosts Ρ Therefore,
now we will call the proud blessed, because they that work wicked-
ness are built up ,· they have tellipted God and have been delivered.
90 Listen‚ however, to what the prophet Ezekiel said: VVoe shall Ezek. vii, 26.
come upon woe, and messenger upon messeuger, and the vision shall
be sought from the prophet, and the law shall perissa from the priest
and counsel from the elders. Again : Thus saith the Lord .· Because Ezek. xiii, 340,
your words are falsehoods, and your divinations vain, on this account
30 behold lam against you, saith the Lord. I will stretch forth my hand

 

 

variations from the text of Codex Alex. (As). Adonai Dominus, frequent in
Sabatier's text and in the Greek of Cod. Alex„ does not appear once in Gildas.
For the most part, Sabatier has printed his Antiqua versio from these extracts
of Gildas; and where he gives other examples, as from Jerorne⁷s Coinmentary,
the text of Gildas, because older, shows sar closer affinity with the LXX. Our
natural conclusion is, here as before, that our author has preserved for us an
especially old type of text. See, on one aspect of this subject, two books that
may be named anew: Schol, De Eccles. Brit. Scoto. Historiae Fontibus, p. 17, and
Haddan and Stubbs, Councils, p. 185 ; neither the statement maelein the former
work, that Gildas had a copy of the Greek version itself (the LXX) for Ezekiel
and other Books, nor in the latter, that the Latin version is “ peculiar to him-
self,'⁷ seem to be borne out by the facts. Gildas is quoting a version that is
very ancient even for the Old Latin—See p. 95.
