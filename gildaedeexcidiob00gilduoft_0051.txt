joining the wretched inhabitants to themselves: they build the
wall in their accustomed mode of structure, in a straight line, across
from sea to sea, between cities, which perhaps had been located
there through sear of enemies; they give bold counsel to the
people in their sear, and leave behind them patterns for the manu-
facture of arms, On the sea coast also, towards the south, where
their ships were wont to anchor, because from that quarter also
wild barbarian hordes were feared, they place towers at stated
intervals, affording a prospect of the sea. They then bid thern
farewell, as men who never intended to return.

 

may be assumed, who, we again remind ourselves is writing not with a historian’s
interest in facts as such, but with 3 reformer⁷s bent to find a moral purpose in
them. He is, however, definite in certain limits he sets to himself. “Those
evils only will I attempt to make public which the island has both suffered and
inflicted upon other and distant citizens, in tlze times os the Roman Emperors'’
(c, 4). The Parthian peace of which Orosius speaks was secured under
Augustus, many years after the death of Julius Caesar, therefore the first expedi-
tion described by Gildas, if after this Parthian truce and the subsequent universal
peace, cannot be the attempted, though barely successful, conquest of Britain by
Caesar. The expedition, according to Gildas, is due to the stubbornness (con-
tumacia) of an unfaithful people (infidelem populum), that is, it was an expedition
topzmz'sh not to conquer. Such a one could only take place “under the Roman
Emperors'' after the ten years' work of conquest and settlement during the reign
of Claudius (A.D. 43-53). The vigorous measures under Vespasian⁷s generals,
particularly Agricola, were intended to advance the Roman occupation, though
Agricola, it is well known, succeeded in attaining larger and more permanent
results. These, also, must precede the events narrated by Gildas.

We, therefore, look out for “a peace with the Parthians,⁷' followed by 3 puni-
tz've expedition to Britain, and find the former in the peace made by Hadrian,
shortly after the death of Trajan, A.D. 117, the latter in the expedition of Hadrian.
Hadrian's policy of caution aimed at the maintenance of peace by restricting
warlike operations “Adeptus imperium . . . tenendae per orbem terrarum paci
operam intendit.” This is said by Aelius Spartianus, who in mentioning the
difficulties adds further: “Britanni teneri sub Romana ditione non poterant.’'
It was then that the great wall from Tyne to Solway was built (ΑΛ), 122).
“Under Hadrian,'' we read in Mommsen⁷s work : ‘⁴ A severe disaster occurred
here, to all appearance a sudden attack on the camp of Eburacum, and the
annihilation of the legion stationed there, the same oth legion which had fought
so unsuccesssully in the war with Boudicca. Probably this was occasioned, not
by a hostile inroad, but by a revolt* of tlte Norlhemz tribes that passed as subjesls
of llze empire, especially of the Brigantes. With this we have to connect the
fact that the wall of Hadrian presents a front towards the south as well as
towards the north ; evidently it was destined also for the purpose of keeping in
check the superficially subdued North of England (The Provz‘nces, i, 188).⁷’ It
may not be wrong to conclude that Gildas, with some confusion in that word
“first Parthian peace,⁷' has selected this instance, first of all, to point his moral of
“evils suffered⁷' for “evils inflicted'⁷ by an “ unfaithsul pe0p1e³³ (Ab. 122-124).
