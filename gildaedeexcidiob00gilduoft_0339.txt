death, succeeded him to the throne. Another, Mailocus, who had
been consecrated by his father to sacred literature, and had been
well-trained therein, came, after abandoning his father, and renounc-
ing his paternal patrimony, to Luyhes, in the district of Elmail.
5 He there built a monastery in which, after serving God earnestly
with hymns and prayerS, sastings and vigila he rested in peace,
distinguished for his virtues and miracles But Egreas, with his
brother Alleccus and their sister Peteova, a virgin consecrated to
God, having also themselves similarly given up their patrimony
10 and renounced worldly pomp, retired to the remotest part of
that country, and at no long distance from each other, built, each
one for himself, an oratory, placing their sister in the middle
one. Both of them alternately, each on his own day, used to
celebrate with her the daily hours and the mass 3 and taking food
15 with her after the vespers, and returning thanks to God, they
returned before sunset, each to his own oratory; for each of them
used to celebrate the vigils separately in his own oratory. Now
those blessed and holy men, whom we have mentioned above, even
Mailocus, Alleccus and Egreas‚ with their saintly sister, after
20 contemning, as was said before, all the wealth and luxuries of the
world, strove with the whole bent of their soul to reach the celestia]
country, and devoted their lives to fastings and prayers. At last
they were called by God, and received the reward of their labours.
They were buried in the oratories which they had built, and are
25 preserved there, famous and illustrious for their constant miracles,
and destined to rise again in glory.
3 Now, the blessed Gildas, who is also called Gildasius, destined
to become the honour and glory of his nation, is entrusted by his
parents to the charge of St. Hildutus, to be instructed by him.

 

The Vita before us represents Illtud to be a Welshman, and so do the
other Vz'loe of the same group; they also agree in placing the monastery
over which he was Abbot on a small island, which may be the one named
Ynys Pyr (Caldy Island) in Mr. William Owen⁷s map. But the Vita printed
by Rees (Cambro—Brz'lislz Saints, p. 158) describes him as a Breton, the son of
a famous soldier named Bicanus and Rieingulid, daughter of Anblaud, king of
Britain; legates had crossed the Gallic sea to fetch the royal bride, whose
name in the Eritish tongue signified “ chaste queen ;'’ and, when the son was
born, “the name Iltutus is given him, implying that he (ille) was safe (tulus)
from every sin.'' He became learned in the seven artS, but took to arms as his
vocation. The soldier crosses to Britain to visit Arthur, who is his cousin 3 and,
after being well received at the court of Arthur, becomes an officer in the service
of Poulentus, King of Gulat Morcantia. He is, however, induced to become a
monk by Cadoc, and in time ordained by Dubricius. The whole Vita teems
