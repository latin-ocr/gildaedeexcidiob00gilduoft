found almost anywhere in the seventh century, under the direction
of men of singularly pure and saintly lives The student of
history will look upon them as phases osa life that is gone for ever3
he is not called upon to censure what is embodied in Penitential
Book-S, nor to set up a defence of them. It is simply necessary
that he should take a right position to view their strange and
elaborate directions. These must be looked upon as means through
which men of deep moral earnestness, such as Dewi Sant and
Gildas in &Vales Finnian‚ Comgall and Columbanus in Ireland
and France, sought to take away the curse of uncleanness out of
the lives of man. In their method‚ they mention things to which
we hardly ever allude, but so does St. Augustine in his ‘⁴ Enquiries
of Pope Gregory‚” and so before him did St. Jerome, in his cele-
brated letter to a young lady of the highest family connections
at Rome. We feel that no pastor would now even think of what
is detailed in Interrogatio Augustini VIII, as given by Beda
(Ι, 27) ; that Epistola 22 ofJerome “ handles, without the slightest
reserve, sins and temptations of the flesh to which we now hardly
allude. It is absolutely inconceivable that any moralist or preacher
of our times, however earnest or fanatical‚ should address a
woman in such a style.'' The writer from whom Ι quote these
words adds: “The difference of tone between the ancients and
ourselves should never be forgotten in studying the character cf
a distant past. By keeping it in mInd we may be saved alike
from phaffisaism, and from an ungenerous judgment of times
which have made a sels-revelation of which we should be

incapable.''l
To me, these Penitentials are reminders of the fierce conflict

waged against the wild immorality of olden times : a conflict which,
with many failures, proved that the clumsy method of these rules
turned out to be for good. Haupt, in his Kz'rcllengescln'chle Deutsclz-
lancis, describes the results of the method in the hands of Columb-
anus in Gaul as “ blissful” (segensreiclz). Yet it was doomed to
die ; in no way could it continue, however usesul for a time.

References will be made in the Notes to several PenitentialS‚
such as the Penitentials of Finnian‚ of Columbanus and others;
on that account it may be of advantage to place here the follow-
ing brief resume' of facts.
