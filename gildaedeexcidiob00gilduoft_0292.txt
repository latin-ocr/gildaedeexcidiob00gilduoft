1 Ut supra. It is difficult to find a meaning for this addition in the case
oftheft‚ since ‘⁶ two years '’ have not been mentioned ; perhaps we are to under-
stand a reference to rule 1, in its provision that after the expiration of half the
time, a relaxation in the severity os penance should ensue.

2 Sacm'ficz'um. The use of this word, and the whole attitude of the outward
reverence towards the Eucharistic rite, shows how sully Britain, by the latter
half of the sixth century, had adopted ideas that found their abiding expression
in Gregory the Great. The Eucharist, according to the view which prevailed
then, is a sacrifice, and the word itself appears in the Welsh segyrffitc (Taliesin
—or the poet so named—Skene‚ Fozcr Ancient Books, 153-156>.

Rules 7-10‚ indicating sins of excessive eating and drinking on the part of

as, for instance, the Penitential of Egbert, xii, 7 : Si per ebrietatem vel
voracitatem evomerit eucharistiam xldz'es peniteat clericus, etc. ; also Beda, vi, 1.

belonged exclusively to a bishop, is here placed in the power osan abbot:
we have a similar instance in the Penitential of Finnian, where a cleric,
aster ten years of penance because of murder, may be reconciled if he be
approved by the evidence of the abbot or priest (testimonio abbatis seu sacer-
dotis). llut in Gaul, where a more authoritative Church organisation prevailed,
Columbanus, in the corresponding rule of his Penitential, inserts “bishop
(episcopi) or abbot.⁷' So also we find the present rule in the Penitential
of Cummean, which was widely used on the continent, prescribing a penance
os sorty days to one who cominunicates with a person “excommunicated by
