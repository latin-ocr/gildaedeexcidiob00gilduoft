exceedingly well versed. Many of these men, after a wicked life,
rather force their way into the priesthood, or buy it at almost any
price, than be drawn into the same; and in the same old and
accursed mire of unbearable crimes, after gaining the priestly

5 chair of episcopate or presbyterate (men who never sat thereon),
meanly wallow like swine. They have violently seized the mere
name of priest‚ without receiving its true meaning or apostolic
worthiness, but as men, who in respect of sound saith and by
repentance for sins, are not yet fit. How do they arrive at and

10 acquire any ecclesiastica} rank, to say nothing of the highest?
because it is a rank which none save the holy and perfect, and
those who imitate the apostles, and, to speak in the words of the
teacher of the gentiles, those without reproach, undertake in a 1 Tim· iii, 2.
legitimate way and without the great sin of sacrilege.

(37 For what is so impious and so wicked as, after the pattern of
Simon Magus, though meanwhile no indiscriminate sins inter-
vene, that any one should wish to purchase the office of bishop or
presbyter for an earthly price, an office that is more becomingly
obtained by holiness and upright character? But the error of

20 those men lies the more grave and desperate in the fact that they
buy counterfeit and unprofitable priesthood, not from apostles or
the successors of apostleS, but from tyrants and from their father
the devil. Nay‚ furthermore, they place upon the edifice of an
infamous life a kind of roos and covering for all sins, in order that

25 admitted desires, old or new, of covetousness and gluttony should
not be easily placed to their charge by any one, seeing that,
having oversight of many, they carry on their pillage with greater
ease. For if truly such a stipulation of purchase had been pre-

 

bought from “tyrants 3²² which means that princes—whom Gildas, a thoroug
imperialist as a civis Romanus, will only name as lyranni—-were able to influence
appointments.

highest gradus, There probably were never any metropolitains or archbishops
in the Eritish Church.

4 Magistri gentium. This—Teacher of the Gentiles—is a favourite appel-
lation with Gildas : it occurs in cc. 72, 73, 97.

5 Fucala el numquam proficlllra. This is an idea which Gildas elsewher
expresses: The priests who buy their office‚not of apostles or successors of
apossses, not even of a godly king, but of tyrants, cannot, in the exercise of
their priestly functions, benefit anyone: they are not priests, barely eve
