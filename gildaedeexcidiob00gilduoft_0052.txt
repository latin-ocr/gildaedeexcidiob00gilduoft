40 De Excidio Britanniae.

2. At what time must we place the second expedition? Unfortunately it is
only described in high-flowing language, almost turgid‚ void of all details : no
name or date is supplied tis. The first impression is that it occurred not long
after troops had been withdrawn owing to the heavy burden of maintaining
them. If so, then we may regard this second visit of the Romans as that which
was made under Pius Antoninus to punish renewed conflicts on the part of the
Brigantes, At that time, the Roman boundary was extended further north and

fixed, though only for a time, by the turf wall built between Clyde and Forth
(A.1›. 143). But there seem to have been serious disturbances in Roman

Britain, as well as renewed attacks by the Caledonians and Maeatae‚ so that
Severus found himself led to interfere by an expedition in 209, during the
operations of which he died at York in 211. Either of these two visits of
Roman forces would fit the description given by Gildas, while the fact that no
further troubles of any kind are mentioned until the end of the fourth century,
may incline us to decide in favour of the expedition of Severus.

3. There is a long interval from 122 or 209 to 383, of which not a word is
said by Gildas. He then introduces Maximus, the “ tyrannus⁷' or usurper, and
makes his first mention of the marauding incursions of the Picts and Scots.
However‚ I believe a good reason for this silence is not far to seek. It
has struck many as strange that this ἡκζτίονῐοὲνάρῐιῑις, as he is called by the
mediaeval writers, should not have said a word about Constantius Chlorus and
his son Constantine embarking together from Boulogne in 306, on purpose to
drive back the Picts and Scots, nor of the splendid deeds of Constantine in the
war against them. There was a more terrible incursion of these barbariam,
aided by the Attacotti, about 368, when the Franks and Saxons also harassed
the opposite Gallie coast, plundering and burning and murdering prisoners.⁹⁵
Yet Cildas makes no mention of this, or of the successful attack made upon
them by Theodosius, father of Theodosius the Great‚ nor is anything said
respecting the rebuilding of ruined cities and military posts, effected by him in
that year (Amm. lllarcell„ xxviii, 3).

Gildas, had he been writing as a historian‚ would be rightly censured for
such grave omissions as these, but his motive and plan is different. On that
account we cannot wonder that he passes by events, however important, which
do not show the Britons to be a guilty people, suffering because of their evil
ways. ln 300 and 368, the Britons were faithful Roman subjects‚ who could in
no way have contributed to the calamities of the empire. It was otherwise in
383. XVas it not Britain herself that sent forth the usurper Maximus? Such is
the view that Gildas takes, and, moreover, his action in denuding Britain of
Roman troops, for the first time afterAgricola's seulement, laid the island bare
to the plundering expeditions of the barbarian tribes. For these reasons, a
inore detailcd account is given both of Maximus himself and of the fresh inroad
ulrich followed his abandonment of the island, than of the two early expeditions
against lssritish revolt. That the usurpation of Maximus could be laid to the
charge of lssritain herself, as Gildas represents the matter, finds no insignificant
