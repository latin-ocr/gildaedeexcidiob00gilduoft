ΒΥ THE MONK OF Rtssvs.

Ι ST. GILDAS, born in the very fertile district of Arecluta, and
descended from his father Caunus, a most noble and Catholic
man, was desirous, from his very boyhood, to follow Christ with
all the affection of his heart. The district of Arecluta, as it forms

‘2 Cazmo. ln the next Wla the father's name is Nalm [vall is probably a
false transcription of Nau (Vide Petrz'e, 440, 442). In Rhys' Appendix on
Welslz lnscrzjfitz'ons, we have probably a feminine form of the name: Brolm-
maglz' iam ic iacit et saror eius Caum (Voelas Hall, Denbighshire). Holder
(All-Cellisclle Sp7·acllsa'mlz> gives Counos, Cawuna, as by forms, and quotes
“A(nnius) Caunus Senorucci filius'' (Bordeaux) Jullian, t. i, 71. 95, p. 226.
The author of Vita cadoci speaks of Gildas as “son of Cau ⁷² (filius Calc), and
in Welsh he is always, I believe, called Caw‚· this fact seems to suggest that
Caunus may have been erroneously written for Cau-us or Cato-ns. But,
though we would gain in this way some interesting apparent identifications,
the lillera sct‘lpla of the oldest document ought not to be lightly put aside.
Cau or Caunus is in Welsh legends also called “ Caw 0 Gwm Cawlwyd ’⁷ (lolo
MSS„ p. 101) ; also ‘⁶ Caw o Dwr Celyn'⁷ in Anglesey, ibid„ 109, 110, perhaps
because the names of many of his supposed sons and daughters are found in
Anglesey. 1 would refer especially to a suggestive note by Mr. Egerton
Phillimore in ls'Cymmr-odor, xi, p. 75, and to n. 6 on p. 116 of Skene's Celtic
Scollcmd, vol. i. A word ought to be added, that to speak as Mr. Skene does,
of there being four Lives of Gildas preserved, is certainly misleading. Really
{llere are but two,· andin the way that Mr. Skene counts, we ought to go
beyond four ; the “one printed by Capgrave'’ (and by Colgan> is an epitome of
the Life by Caradoc (our Visa Il) ; while the “fourth in the British Museum
still in MS.⁷² appears to be a French fanciful account of Gildas, founded upon the
one printed in these pages.

According to this Vita l, Caw had four sons and one daughter, but the next
one gives him twenty-four sons 3 while as Caw of Twrcelyn, in Anglesey, he has
daughters as well as sons among his numerous progeny. Of the four names
given in this place, Welsh forms of three are found in the names of llam
in Anglesey ; but it would be wrong to decide that those are the names of the
sons of Caw, or to say that those churches are ⁴‘ dedicated '² to them. See
next page, note 2.
