92 De Excidio Britanniae.

read in the Christian communities and the monasteries, present to us a
very strange sight. whole books show the rude, over-literal rendering of the
oldest type of version ; others give indications of the early revision which this
had undergone, and others were read in the new form that eventually became the
common property of all western Churches. But the pages before us seem to
me to suggest another fact of no common interest. 1 gather that in his youth,
let us say during his stay at the Monastery of Illtud, some years before and
after A.D. 520, Gildas was not acquainted with Jerome⁷s version. If 50, the
introduction of it into Britain was contemporary with his own growth in life
and experience. From this arises another significant conclusion, viz., that the
spread of the Vulgate was due to the spread of monasticism, and especially to
the influence of such men as Illtud, whom one may regard as the first Teacher,
in the best sense, of our nation. Here are a few instances out of many that
carry our thoughts in this direction. The two books of Isaiah and Jeremiah,
in the continuous quotations, copied, no doubt, by the writer with a codex before
him, are from the Vulgate version ; but in C. 40 Gildas quotes the well-known
words of Isaiah lvii, 21, apparently from memory : There is nopeace, saitlz my
God, to tlte wicked .· Vg. Non est pax impiis, dicit Dominus Deus. Now Gildas
had learnt the words as follows ; Non est gaudere inpiis, dicit Dominus, a rude,
literal rendering of οὐκ ἔστιν χαίρειν τοῖς ἀσεβέσιν = leere is no being· joyful sor
she wicked. Again, in c. 21, from the same prophet, we have i, 4 : Clzildren that
are corruplens ,f they luzve sorsaken tlte Lord, they luzve provoked the Holy One
of [smel unlo anger: Vulgate z Vae . . . . filiis sceleralis; dereliquerunt
Dominum, blasplmnaverzmt sanctum Israel. Here again Gildas has a very
different text : Filii sine lege, dereliquistis Deum, et ad iracundiam prouocaslis
sanctum lsrael, which is a ruder rendering, if anything‚ than the former instance,
Of the LXX 2 υἱοὶ ἄνομοι, ἐγκατελίπατε τὸν κύριον καὶ παρωργίσατε τὸν ἅγιον τοῦ
Ἰσραὴλρθ passages os the same character might be adduced from Jeremiah,
as, for instance, Jer. xxxii, 39 in c. 40, or Genesis 5, 24, as a mixed form. The
New Testament was mainly read in the Vulgate version, with Old Latin
readings interspersed, more numerous in some books than others. For many of
these there is independent MS. evidence. However, when Gildas, in c. 36, writes
such well-known words as, “Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy
ladeu, and I will give you rest,⁷' the last words read: et ego vos requiescere
faciam, which is the reading of the Old Latin Codex Brixianus (f). In cc. 106-
109 quotations are given from four lectiones, which were read at ordination out
of an ancient formulary. These are portions of Acts, Ι Timothy, Ι Peter, and
Matthew xvi, 16-19‚ and the version is Old Latin. Of the same type is the
extract from II Timothy in Fragment A, iii.

Certain qualifications are, indeed, necessary with respect to the parts last-
mentioned, but there seems to be on the whole, and especially when we look at
the first examples, a clear indication that Gildas, at that time of life when
words of Scripture impress themselves sor ever upon the memory, knew the Old
Latin version, and the Old Latin only. Our aim, just now, is sor a perspec-
tive view, and we find it instructive: we gather that a writer who had just

both, probably, being expressed by the same abbreviations in the older MSS„
us. DM.
