Cover stomach, chest with the lungs,
veins, sinews, gall-bladder with ......
Cover flesh, groin with the inner parts,
spleen with the winding intestines
Cover bladder, fat and all
the numberless orders ofjoints.
Cover hairs, and the rest of my limbs,
whose nameS‚ may be, Ι have passed by.
Cover me all in all with my five senses,
and with the ten doors formed (for me),
so that, from my soles to the top of the head,
in no member, without within, may I be sick ;
that, from my body, life be not cast out
by phgue, sever, weakness, suffering,
Until, with the gift of old age from God,
I blot out my sins with good works ;
And, in departing from the flesh‚ be free from stain,
and be able to fly to the heights,
and, by the mercy of God, be borne in joy
to the heavenly cool retreats of His kingdom.

6 Sem’am, 3 fem. sing. from the pl. nent. sensa os sensum. See p. 302 ; we
may add that moenia, moeniae, moenium may be found in Gregory of Tours and
in MSS. of the New Test. The neuter was, no doubt, disappearing from the
spoken Latin in the sixth century. Isidore quaintly says (Ex. XI, ii, 8) z Sem'mn
autem pars est ultima senectutis, dicta quod sit terminus sextae aetatis.

⁷ It should not be left quite unnoticed how, in this verse, we have 3 glimpse
osa conviction in &Velsh circles that was probably universal in the sixth century;
some would regard it as 3 feature of that semi-Augustinianism to which the
Church had come at that time. The writer of the Hymn hopes to blot out
former sins by good deeds‚ which he would regard 35 a satisfaction to God.
The belief is, however, quite evident in African writers of the third century,

κὶα, in Tertullian and Cyprian.
