107 These, without doubt, are things commanded by the apostle,
and were read on the day of your ordination that you might keep
them inviolably, but in no wise have they been kept by you with
judgment, nay, hardly have they been thought of or understood.

5 Below‚ he says z Putn'ng away therefore all wickedness and all guile Ι Peter ii, 1-3.
and lijqoocrisy and enm! and evil speakings, as new born babes,
reasonable ‚clud without guile, desire mille tlzat ye may gt‘Ow tliereby
nnto salvation, because tlte Lord is kind. Consider also ,whether
these words be trodden under foot because heard by you too

10 frequently with deas ears. Again : Butye are an elect race, a royal Ι Peter ii. 9-
priestltood, a lloly nation, a people for adoption, tliat ye may sllew tlte
excellencies of H im wllo liatli called yon ont (ff darkness into tltat vely
wonderful leght of His. Not only are the excellencies of God not
slzown through you, but even, by most corrupt exampleS, despised

15 among all unbelieverS. You heard, no doubt, on the same day,
what was read in the lesson from the Acts of the Apostles. Peter,
rising in tlte midst of tlte disciples, said: Men and bremme, it isActsi,15,1‹5.
needfnl tliat tlte Scriptum slionld be fnlfilled, wlciclz tlte Holy Gllost
fol‘etold by tlte montli of David concerning sudas. And shortly

20 after : This man obtained a field willa tlze reward of iniquit-ys. This ,4ch i, 18.
you heard heedlessly, or rather with obtuse heart, as if it had not
been read of you. Who of you, Ι ask, does not seek a field with
the reward of iniquity? ForJudas was wont to thieve coffers ; you
waste the church gifts and the souls of her sons. He went to the

25 Jews to sell G0d3 you to tyrants and your father the devil, to
despise Christ. He held the Saviour of all as one to be sold
for thirty pieces of silver ; you for even a single penny.
