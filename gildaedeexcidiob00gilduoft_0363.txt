T he Life of Gz'ldas. 351

Blavetum under a certain overhanging rock : he hollowed out the
rock itself from west to east, raised a wall on its right side, and
thus made a suitable oratory, underneath which he caused a
fountain of clear water to issue forth from the rock. But when
5 St. Gildas wished to close up the east window of that oratory
with glass, and could not find any glass, he prostrated himself on
the ground, and prayed to the Lord. On rising from his prayer,
he went off to a certain rock; and from that very rock, by the
bountifulness of the Lord, he brought excellent glass. He also
10 made a mill there, to which he put the wheat, and which he turned
with the hand. This mill is preserved in the same place up to the
present day, and into it, as the merits of the saint avail with
Christ, sick Christians banish all their ailments. Nor must we
pass by in silence the following miracle also, which the Lord
15 wrought through him. For, as he was one day tarrying with his
brethren in his cell, some guests came to him. He joyfully wel-
comed them and led them to prayer, and showed every kindness
to them, washing both their hands and feet, and with love gave
whatsoever he had. But as he had not wine to offer them, he
20 prayed, and then bade the servants fill the wine-vessels with water3
and when he had blessed it, the water, hythe divine command,
was turned into the best wine. VVondering at this power, all who
were present returned thanks to the Almighty Lord, who, in
His Gospel, has promised to His faithful followers: The work-s

25 that I de, slcall tlzey do also ,· and greater works illan these slzalllolzn xiv, 10

llcey do.

18 But, although he was a man of such character and greatness
that God worked so many miracles through him, he nevertheless
placed before himself no one, but appeared to be more lowly than

30 any. Although, indeed, he held the office of an abbot,nevertheless,
that he might show to his inferiors an example of lowliness‚

according to the divine precept which says, He tlmz} is greater Mataxxii‘,

among you shall be a servant, he himself also would strive to be a
servant to all. And that he might not be a deaf listener to the

35 Lord Jesus, who says, Learn ο] Me, for l am meek and lowly in illast. xi

lleart, he was in this also diligent to obey the commandments of

the Lord his Saviour: for as it has been written of Moses:NmH,xfi‚3,

 

by a chapel, where are found also two compartments and two altars in com-
memoration of the two Saints.”—M. Alexandre M. Thomas' note, “ Ermitage
du Blavet'’ in Albert le Grand, Les Vz'es des Saz'nts‚ p. 29.
