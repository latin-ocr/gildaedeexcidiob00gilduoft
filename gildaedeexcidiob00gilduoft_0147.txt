The Codex Amiatinus contains in its prefatory matter three lists of books of
the Old and New Testaments, which, as touching upon the question of Gildas’
arrangement in this place, may be quoted in part. They are as follows: (1)
The arrangement of the Codex itself: In hoc codice continentur ueteris et noui
testamenti Libri N LXXX13 Genesis ..... Malachias, Job, Thobias, Iudith,
Hester, Erras (zEzra and Nehemiah), Machabeorum lib. duo. (2) The books
according to the Hieronymian division. (3) The arrangement sicut diuidit
sanctus Hilarus Romanae urbis antistes et Epiphanius Cyprius : Genesi . . . .
Malachim qui et Angelus, Iob, Tobis, Hester, Iudith, Esdrae libri duo (Ezra
and Nehemiah), Machabeorum libri duo (Studm Bz'hlim, ii, 290 ffi). Omitting
the books not quoted by Gildas, we have in the British Codex itself, and in
the list according to Hilarius and Epiphanius, which corresponds with the order
“according to the ancient version⁷⁷ given by Cassiodorus, the very arrange-
ment of Gildas, viz., Malachi‚sob, Esdras. He is thus shown to be following
a traditionary order of the sacred books.

3. But he must have had more than the “two books'' of Esdras in this very
place. Besides 1 Esdras=Ezra, and 2 Esdras=Nehemiah, he may have had
in his copy 3 Esdras=1 Esdras of our Apocrypha, and, probably, chapters κν,
xvi, or XV, xvi, 1, ΙΙ, of 4 Esdras, that is, of 2 Esdras in the Apocrypha of the
English or &Velsh Authorised Versions. I have been impressed by the cogent
remark of Dillmann that, except for the printing press (tle. since A.D. 1462), this
4 Esdras would never have appeared as one book. As printed it has issued
from one MS„ or from copies of that MS„ the Codex Sangermanensz‘s, formerly

revealed by the study of British MSS. of the Latin Bible. It is brought before
the reader at some length in M. Samuel Berger's Histoire de la Wzlgate,
pp. 35 ff. Not long after the last os the group of men to whom Gildas belonged,
the disciples of Illtud‚ had passed away, the English and British Churches
parted violently asunder and stood in formal hostility the one to the other.
Soon the British and Scot (Irish) churches were openly pronounced to be
schismatic; but amid all this conflict there are evident signs, judging by
copies of Scripture or parts thereos, that there was, nevertheless‚ friendly inter-
course os practical life between the two Churches. The Saxon Church benefited,
so sar as to borrow certain definite peculiarities of the texts copied in its

cloisters, from the Celtic Church, which, earlier in the North and later in the
west, was persuaded by it to abandon those points on which it was held to
stand outside Catholic unity. ‘⁶ Ne dites pas qu’il importe peu a l'histoire de la
Vulgate, et que le Codex Amiatimcs, rapporte' a Rome en 716 par les serviteurs
de Ceolfrid, n'etait que la copie d’un autre manuscrit qu'il avait lui-meme
apporte de Rome : double voyage d’un texte qui retourne a son lieu d'origine.
Le Codex Amiatinus ne peut pas etre identique au manuscrit romain sur
lequel il a ete copie ..... Nous avons deja constate, et nous verrons par de
nouveaux exemples que les copistes saxons ne savaient pas copier un texte
etranger sans lui donner, pour ainsi dire, la couleur locale des textes de leur
pays⁷' (M. Berger, p. 37).

Just as the hard struggle against the Saxons did not prevent the wide
diffusiori osa new Bible (the Vulgate) in the British Churches, so also the bitter
feud between two Churches was not such as to prevent co-operation in the
further preparation of copies of this new Bible for use in the English Churchi
