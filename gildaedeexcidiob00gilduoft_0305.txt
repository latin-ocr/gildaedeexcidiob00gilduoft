T lae Lorz‘ca of Gz'ldas. 293

31 May they protect me henceforth from the demons of the mist,

36 May 1 be under the hand of God in every danger.” ¹

But a fragment, without any title whatever, has come to light
lately, which, in some respects, bears a far closer resemblance to
the Lorz‘ca of Gildas than any known before. It was published‚
with valuable comments, by Dr. V. H. Friedel in the Zez'tscllrift
fiir Celtzkclze philologia, Band ii, 1 s., 64 ff. (1898), from a Leyden
MS„ under the title La Lorica de Leyde. This valuable piece of
Celtic Latinity has, certainly, remarkable points of similarity
when compared with our Lwim, chiefly in the detailed enumera-
tion of parts of the human body expressed in very rude Latin
terms, of the origin of which, ancl the meaning, in fact, it is
extremely difficult to give account. Several of these are common
to the two Hymns, and, as we shall note presently, to other
fragments and writings acknowledged to be of Celtic origin and
character. In addition to this, the style of invocation has a partial
resemblance to that of Gildas‚ with a notable difference: there
are the same invocations addressed to angelic hosts, patriarchs,
confessors, apostles and martyrs, but the invocation of the Trinity‚
found in Gildas' Lorz'ca and found in other Loricae, is wanting. I
am strongly inclined to believe that the Leyden piece is not a
Lorz'ca in the true sense, that is as a prayer for protection; it
repeats two petitions only, first, that the body in all its members
be searchedf secondly, that heavenly powers and saints cleanse the
heart of him (or her, n.b. illam) who makes use of the prayer.
There is here no idea that we connect with a Lorz'ca. The
direction, however, given in the first line for the recitation or
reading of Psalm 101 (102 of the English or Welsh version) may
imply that the Psalm itself is the Lorica? while the fragment is
the prayer of a penitent. The reasons for printing lee Lorz'ca

(gf Leyden here will at once become evident on comparison of it
with Gildas’ Hymn.
