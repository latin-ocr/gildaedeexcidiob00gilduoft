64 De Excidio Brilanm'ae.

dictis propemodum ordinibus appareat, exceptis paucis¹ et valde
paucis, qui ob amissionem tantae multitudinis quae cotidie prona
ruit ad tartara, tarn brevis numerus habentur, ut eos quodammodo
venerabilis mater ecclesia2 in suo sinu recumbentes non videat, quos

solos veros filios habet. Quorum ne quis me egregiam vitam 5

omnibus admirabilem Deoque amabilem carpere putet, quibus
nostra infirmitas in sacris orationibus ut non penitus conlabatur,
quasi columnis quibusdam ac fulcris saluberrimis sustentatur, si
qua liberius de his, immo lugubrius, cumulo malorum conpulsus,
qui serviunt non solum ventri, sed diabolo potius quam Christo,
qm' est benedictus in saccula Dens, non tam disceptavero, quam
deflevero. Quippe quid celabunt cives, quae non solum norunt,
sed exprobrant iam in circuitu nationes?

 

¹ This passage mentions two generations. first, there were the men who
had witnessed the disasters suffered from the Saxons and had survived them to
enjoy a time of quiet in lives void of reproach. Secondly, after they had passed
away, there came a generation of men who, like Gildas himself, had experience
only of 1116 period ofnon—lnolestation by outside enemies. It is the deterioration
of these that he laments in the present work. But there are also the few select

ones, so few that even the venerable mother, the chruch, hardly knous them ”

as her only real sons. Who are they ? To answer this question fully we must
consult cc. 65, 69, 92 ; yet in the main it would be right to say that he has the
monks in his thoughts. We find a reference to this passage in c. 65, and
therein also, it may be mentioned in passing, strong evidence that this work of
Gildas never really consisted of two different parts—Historia and Epz'sfola—
much less that they were written at different times. “1 ask pardon of these
men, as Ι have said in a previous part,'' so writes Gildas in the chapter named,
“whose life Ι 1101 only praise, but also esteem above all the wealth of the
world, and of which, if possible, Ι long for a share, sometime, before Ι die.⁷'
For Gildas, and, apparently, for 1115 contemporaries also, in both the Irish and
British churches, the original idea of monasticism had undergone a great
change. It had ceased to be a purely contemplative life, or one of secluded dis-
cipline of the individual soul unto holiness, sls Eucher's beautiful De lelelllplll
illlmdz' describes it. (fildas, though a monk, is mixing in the battle of
public life, and the present work is part of 1116 [ask which he fearlessly carried
out. “There was a prophet of the people in 1116 111116 os the Britons called (iil-
