PART II.

General Dcmmcialion of Pl'z'nces and J flagres.

27 KINGS Britain has, but they are as her tyrants: she has judges,
but they are ungodly men 1 engaged in frequent plunder and dis-
turbance, but of harmless men: avenging and defending, yea for
the benefit of criminals and robberS. They have numerous wives,

5 though harlots and adulterous women z they swear but by way of
forswearing, making vows yet almost Immediately use falsehood.

They make wars, but the wars they undertake are civil and unjust

01165. They certainly pursue 11116165 industriously throughout

the country, whilst those thieves who sit with them at table, they

not only esteem but even remunerate. Alms they give profusely,
but over against this they heap up a huge mountain of crimes.

They take their seat to pronounce sentence, yet seldom seek the

rule of right judgment. Despising the innocent and lowly, they

to their utmost extol to the stars the bloody-minded, the proud,

. 15 the murderous men, their own companions and 1116 3611111610115
6116111165 of God, if chance so offers, who ought, together with their
very name, to be a-ssiduously destroyed. Many 11316 they bound
in their prisons, whom they ill—use with weight of chains, more by
their own fraud than by reason of desert: they linger among the

20 altars in the oaths they make, and shortly afterwards look with
disdain on these same altars as if they were dirty stones.

‘⁶ Of greater significance was the change of form which came in during
the fifth century, that is, the substitution for the table—altar of the closed
altar. This last form is not found before the fifth century, and it appears that
it was not the prevailing form in Christian antiquity. The Eastern Church 1135
generally kept to the table form. On the other hand, there can be no doubt
that the change had its motive in 1116 61111 01· adoration of inartyrs. W'e can go
further, and say that the origin of this form of altaris to be §ought in 1116
martyr chapels, from whence, in a time disposed to the adoration of martyrs,
they found their way easily into the churches.” (ξ 13, pp. 117-119.) These
martyr chapels were common in Britain before 540, but a still 111016 significant
change is implied in the words snler (illaria jurando demorantes, “they linger

puted evidence of more than one altar in the same church. (Erst am Ende des
