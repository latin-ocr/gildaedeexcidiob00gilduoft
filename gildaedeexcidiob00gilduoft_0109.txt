no doubtdue solely to transcription. Now the Greek Old Testament, especially
in Job, Ezekiel, and the minor Prophets, though itself a version, stands in the
place of an original to the Latin text from which Gildas copied. On this
account, Ι have ventured, a few times, to change the structure of a sentence, or
the case of a noun, in accordance with the Greek from which the Latin was
evidently made. The German edition, in its textual notes, refers us to the
Vulgate version by way of elucidation in several of these cases, but the extreme
literalness of the Old Latin translation seems to justify a reference to the
Greek as a safe guide: safer sometimes than that which the limited MS.
authority we possess can furnish. The ampler apparatus criticus now pro-
vided in the Third Volume of Swete's edition of the LXX, containing the
Prophets, renders this process still safer.

1. From the very outset of his work Gildas, following a way of writing com-
mon since Origen, naturally falls to making long quotations from Scripture.
XVhere these are short or well-known phrases, we may well take for granted that
they are made from memory. There are, however, in one part of the work,
twenty—four Chapters almost devoid of any Scriptural words, though allusions
are frequent. These are ce. 3—26, which only contain five or six quotations.
But after the historia flebilis of the five Welsh princeS, that is, from c. 38 to
c. 63, the quotations are made consecutively and, in some cases, at great
length. These are addressed to judges and princes of the land.

A similar series of quotations from the Old Testament is found in the portion
which deals with the clergy of his time, first from c. 76 to c. 91, and then out
of the New Testament in cc. 92—105. It will be seen that the first series
contains no quotations from the New Testament. But in the two portions, the
books named stand in the same order. They are as follows :

First Series, Ι and ΙΙ Samuel, I Kings, II Chronicles, Isaiah, Jeremiah,
(Joel omitted), Habakkuk, Hosea, Amos, Micah, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zecha-
riah, Malachi, Job, IV Esdras (II Esdras in the Apocrypha of the English
Bible), Ezekiel, W'isdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus (vide Note, cc. 62-64).

Second Series,l Samuel, I Kings (Chronicles omitted), Isaiah, Jeremiah,
joel, (Habakkuk omitted), Hosea, Amos, Micah, Zephaniah (Haggai omitted),
Zechariah, Malachi, (Job and Esdras omitted), Ezekiel, (XVisdom and Eccle-
siasticus omitted).

This order, which, being the same in both lists, must be regarded as the
accepted one in Britain, differs widely from the order in which the books
appear in the Vulgate. Neither does it correspond to that found in the leading
MSS. of the LXX.

2. The position ofJob and Ezekiel in the two series will most of all draw the
attention of a reader. But Gildas is not alone in this. The treatise called
Speculum (m), an anonymous work, for long ascribed to Augustine, but by some
regarded to be as late as the Sth or oth century,÷÷ places Ezekiel along with Daniel
