T lie Ruz'n of Britain. 16 5

do not reprove the people on account of their sins, nay, in fact,
they commit the same; they despise the commandments of Christ,
and are careful to satisfy their own lusts with all their prayers:
they get possession of the seat of the apostle Peter with unclean
5 feet, but, by the desert of cupidity, fall into the unwholesome chair
of the traitor Judas Truth they hate as an enemy, and favour lies
as if they were their dearest brothers: the righteous poor they
eye like huge serpents, with fierce countenanceS, and respect the
rich impious, with no touch of shame, like angels from heaven.
10 They preach that alms should be given to the needy, with all the
power of their lips, but they themselves contribute not a penny.
Silent as to abominable sins of the people, they magnify their own
injuries as if inflicted upon Christ. They drive out of house a
religious mother, may be, or sisters‚ and unbecomingly make
15 light of strange women, as if for a more hidden service, or rather,
to speak the truth, though it be of improper things—not so much
for me as for the men who do such things—they demean them.

 

2 Aserilo cupiditatis. We find merito here used as a preposition :propter
with accus. Instances may be found in ecclesiastical Latin, such as Cyprian,
711, 4 (Hartel). Cum lamen merito benedictionis : Sulp. Sev., Chron„ i, 12, 7 3
Artcz.2·ersz‘712erz'lo obsequiorum carissimus, ib„ ii, 11, 1. One early instance I
have met with (in a review of Hoppe, De Sermone Tertulliano, in VVo'lfflin's
Archiv. >‚ Domitianum saevitiae merito poenas luisse : Suetonius, Vesp„ 1.

3 Religionem forle mairem sen sorores domo pellente& Gildas has in mind
the rule established by the well-known Canon 3 of Nicaea : “The great Synod
wholly refuses to bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or in short anyone in the
ranks of the clergy, the right to have a strange woman (in their homes), only a
mother, or sister, or aunt, or solely such persons as incur no suspicion.'' Such
a woman is termed συνείσακτος, subintroducta, in this and in numerous canons
repeatedly passed down into the eighth century. The habit condemned, may
have included constant cases where there was no real ground of suspicion,
clerics and chaste women living under the same roof in strict purity. Yet gross
indecencies arose ; under cover of a specious plea of spiritual intercourse, carne
the secretius ministerium of which Gildas mockingly speaks. A complaint of
like nature is made against two ssritish presbyters in Armorica, by Licinius,
Metropolitan of Tours (509-521), before this work of Gildas had been written.
The women in his letter are termed conhoipilcze. The article on δικίιίνιίῑυιῖίίιῖιιε’,
in the Dicl. of Chr. Ant„ gives a full account of the many canons that,
time after time, sternly condemned a habit which, we see from this
passage, had taken deep root in Britain. But in other countries we hear
the same invective, so that Britain was by no means alone in this immoral
custom. “Pudet dicere proh nefas ; triste sed verum est : Unde in ecclesias
agapetarum pestis introiit? Unde sine nuptiis aliud nomen uxorum? Imo
unde novum concubinarum genus ?⁷’ So wrote an earlier monk than Gildas—
Jerome—in 384. <See p. 155.)
