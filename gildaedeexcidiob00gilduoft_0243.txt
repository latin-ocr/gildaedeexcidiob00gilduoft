what we see on the increase in our time, he says : Ever learning, 11 Tim. iii.
and never coming to the knowledge of the truth. For as [amnes and 7'9'
Mambres wz'thstood Μ oses, so do these also withstand the trnth ‚-
men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the saith ‚· but they shall

as theirs also zeias.
He indicates plainly how priests should show themselves in
their office, when writing as follows to Titus: Present thyself an Tit· ii, 7¹ 8-
&ample of good works, in doctrine, in incorrnptness, in gravitas,
10 holding a sonnd word that cannot he condemned ,· that he tlmt is of
the contram) part may sear, having no evil to say of us. Again, to
Timothy: Snffer hardship as cz good soldier cys sesns Christ. No 11 Tim. ii, 3-5-
man warrz'ng for God entangleth himself in the affizirs of the world,
that he may please him to whom he hath approved himsetf. For also
15 the man who contendeth in the gome is not crowned unless he hath
contended lazcfitlly. These words are an exhortation to the good.
But what the epistle likewise comprises is denunciation of bad
men, such as you appear to all men of understanding. Jfany man 1 Tim. vi. 3-5·

of ordination in Britain consisted only of the symbolic act of anointing the
hands of those ordained, with an accompanying special prayer regarded as the
benedictio, or consecration, and the reading of appropriate Scriptural Iessons.
It was too common a practice, as Gildas informs us, for men to betake thern-
selves beyond seas when there was opposition at home, for the sake of receiving
ordination ; that Gildas represents this as being (lone by the bad, the dissolute,
and simoniacal priests of his day, is indeed strong evidence for a sense of
order in the British Church. T ransnavigare maria terrasque spatiosas trans-
meare non tam piget quam delectat (c. 67) ; bnt when men are thus said to cross
seas, and travel over vast tracts of country, we must suppose that the places
resorted to by them would be somewhere in Gaul, perhaps Armorica, where
their compatriots had been making settlements for two or three generations;
perhaps, further inland. The fact, however, that this was done by wicked
priests, who dared not omit regular ecclesiastica] forms, will in no way exclude
the possibility and probability, that other men, of approved lives and motives,
were at times also ordained abroad. &Vere we to believe the Welsh Vitae, such
an occurrence was far from being rare. In this way we gather that intercourse
with the continent would naturally tend to promote similarity in Church usages,
and particularly in such a rite as ordination, which lay at the root of all com-
