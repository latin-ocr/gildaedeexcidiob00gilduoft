Vita Gz‘ldae. 39 3

the way in which Geoffrey of Monmouth mentions his “contem-
porary,’' Caradoc, or, as the old Welsh version seems to imply, his
“ fellow-worker.”1 We have, undoubtedly, solid historical ground to
stand upon in these words with which Geoffrey of Monmouth
closes his Historia Regum Britanniae: “As to the kings who
afterwards ruled in wales, I commit them to my contemporary
Caradoc of Lancarban, to write” (Book xii, 20).

We notice that Geoffrey calls his friend “Caradoc of Lan-
carban”‚ and the same form of the name appears in the distich
with which the Vita closes, as given by Ussher’s MS„ though not
in our text. The suggestion has been made from time to time,

by writers well verscd in these subjects, that Lan Carban is a
corruption from Nant arrham, or, after euphonic loss of t, from

Nancarban. The note on p. 347 of Owen's Pembrokeslzire tells us:
“The modification of Nant into Llan is common in Wales; thus
Nanlzyfer (Nevern) became lezlzyser, Nan! Hona'a'u Llanllzouy,
Nant T eyrnon Llantamnan‚ Nant Carfan Llancarvan, etc.'' The
explanation that the change may be partly explained by glan,
“a bank'’‚ seems to me excluded by the Latin, e.g.‚ Comen abbas
Carbani uallis (Bookof Llanddv, passim, pp. 147-1 5 7), and Carbana
vallis of this Vita, for which the only possible Welsh is that on
p. 145 of the former book, viz., Nant Carban.

The compound of Llan (z monastery) appears also in the same
book, as on p. 274, magister sancti Catocz· a'e Lamecarnan, and in
the Vim Cadaei, but the employment of it by Geoffrey is very
significant3 the two names are found in one chapter (9) of the
Visa Cadaei, where we learn that the precipuum monaslerium is
Lancarvan, and that “the principale sancti Cadaei oppidum was
called by the ancient settlers of the Britons Nant caruguan,
which means the valley of deer, hence Nantcarbania.'' It seems a
sound conclusion to regat-d the names as equally correct, simply
remembering that Llancarfan implies the cloister‚ while Nancarfan
denotes the locality.

Geofsrey of Monmouth died in the year 1154 (Brun, Evans'
edition‚p. 318), so that the active life of Caradoc, his contemporary
and intimate, may also be placed approximately about the middle
of the twelfth century.
