¹ If we read this section with care we find that Gildas is not referring to the
introduction of Christianity into Britain ; his meaning seems to be that the sun
rose for Britain as sor the whole world by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He
is evidently taking his information (zet scimus) from the Latin version of
Eusebius⁷ Chrom‘con. This reads : ‘⁴ When Pilate sent information to Tiberius
of the doctrine of the Christians, Tiberius referred it to the Senate, so that it
should be received among the other sacred records. But when it was decided
by the city fathers that the Christians should be expelled from Rome, Tiberius
in an edict threatened the accusers of the Christians with death. Tertullian
writes so in his Apologeticus⁷⁷ (Pilato de Christianorum dogmate ad Tiberiane
mjfhrenle T zherz'us retulit ml senatum, ut inser celera sacra reciperetur. Verum
cum ex consulto pals-um Christianos eliminari Urbe placm'sset, Tiberius per
edictum accusatoribus Clzmssvlzkmormn ccmlmimzlus est moriem. Scribit T erlul-
lianus in Apologelico. An. Abr. 2053.) Eur. Clu-072„ Schone‚ ii, p. 151.

respecting the evangelisation of Britain. XVhether he knew more as to the
first preachers of Christianity it is impossible to tell, but his words imply that
its spread among the native population (incolae) of the island was exceedingly
stow: they received it “coldly.” Among Roman officials and foreign immi-
grants it may have spread early, so that the few remains which now attest an
carly Christian church in Britain belong to them, and are found in the parts
most thoroughly Romanised. According to the evidence furnished by
lluhner's serenth volume of Latin inscriptions, we gathcr that heathenism of
various types continued long, even among these provincials. Mithra and
(yla-le. 'l‘yrian Hercules and l'hoenician Astarte, had their worshippers: at
York there was a temple to Serapis, and at Caerlleon, in South XVales, the
Ix'oinztn Legate, Postumius Varus, restores a temple of Diana late in the third
(vntury, that is, not very long before that Council of Arles (314) which we
know so well. Christian inscriptions are more numerous in XVales than in any
other part os lli-itinn, yet neither there nor in the other parts do they indicate a
