kindled for us bright lamps of holy martyrs. The graves where their
bodies lie, and the places of their suffering, had they not, very
many of them, been taken from us the citizens on account of our
numerous crimes, through the disastrous division caused by the
barbarianS, would at the present time inspire the minds of those
who gazed at them with a far from seeble glow of divine love.
I speal( of Saint Alban of Verulam, Aaron and Iulius, citizens of
Caerlleon, and the rest of both sexes in different placeS, who stood
firm with-lofty nobleness of mind in Christ's battle.

The former of these, through love, hid a consessor when pursued -
by his persecutors, and on the point of being scized, imitating in
this Christ laying down his life for the sheep. He first concealed Jolm x, 15.

in his Noles (m Beda, says that “the story of Aaron and Julius must be con-
sidered extremely doubtful‚‘’ and refers us to Hada'zm and Stobos, i, 6, for con-
firmation. One finds it difficult to understand why this story must be doubted.
There must have been a tradition to this effect at Caerlleon in the sixth century,
and in the Book osLlandav we find evidence of the very local tradition that has
been said to be want-ing. The Index of that book mentions about eighteen
place-names beginning with lllerlllz‘r(modern Welsh, Merthyr), one of which is
i‘llerllzir [lin (Iulii) et A aron. A mertllyr means, as its Latin original martyrium
denotes, “place of martyr or martyrs,²' that is, a church built in memory of a
martyr, and generally over his grave. The word is found in Jero sne’s chronicon :
C nius industria 2'72 Hierosol. marlyrz'mn miramon es& it is used also by
Adamnan in his De Locis Sacris .· inter illam quoque Golgollmm bosz'liccml cl

um, Graeca derivatione, eo quod z'tz memoriam martyris sit constructum, vel
quod sepulcra sanctarum ibi sunt nmrlyrum (Greek, τὸ μαρτύριον). We can
hardly doubt that such a name as Merthyr, from umrlyrium, is as old as llam,
or sil, or dszerl, if not indeed older. This at once carries it beyond the sixth
century. Now the boundary of this particular merllziris: “The head of the
dyke cm the Usk,· along the dyke to the breast of the hill, along the dyke to
the source of Nant Merthyr, that is Amir’⁷ (pp. 225, 226, 377). Here we have a
merthyr of Julius and Aaron in the neighbourhood of Caerlleon. A grave
objection may meet us here 3 many of the persons whose merlllyr survives as a
place-name belong to the mythical progeny of Brychan, killed, it is said, by the
‘⁶ pagan Saxons,⁷' These shadowy beings cannot disturb the main argument.
