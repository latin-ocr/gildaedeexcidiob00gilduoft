Doublful Fragments. 271

XI. THE ROMANS SAY: The tradition is that the tonsure of the
British took its origin from Simon Magus, whose tonsure reached
only from ear to ear, following the very excellence of the tonsure
of sorcerers, by which only the fore part of the forehead was wont

sto be covered. But that the first originator of this tonsure in
Ireland was a swine-herd of King Loegaire mac Neill, is made
evident by the word of Patrick. From him nearly all the Irish
assumed this tonsure.

 

custom, called Eastern, because it has to this day continued in Eastem Churches,
wherein chrism was administered by a presbyter; that is, to revert to Augustine's
word, wherein baptism was “completed⁷’ in a n0n<R0man fashion.

1 This Fragment may be found printed and quoted as part of Fragment X,
but the introductory words, Romam⁴ dicunt, seem to demand a separate place.
They, and the whole, are certainly impossible as words of Gildas; in the
second edition of Wasserschleben’s lx⁷anmzelzsmmlzlang they appear as Hibern„
lii, 6, and are printed “Romani dicunt,'⁷ with “ Gz'ldas ait’' preceding, under
the general title: De tonsura Brittomtm el solemnitate el missa. By “ Romans’'
must be understood those who, in the English Church, represented the Roman
contentiori that the native Celtic Church was deviating from “the unity of the
Catholic Church,'' by its persistent attachment to the frontal tonsure. While
the British regarded their peculiar tonsure as derived from St. John, calling it
tonsura S. johannis, or even from St. James (tonsura S. jacobi), the English
gave it a schismatic character and origin by tracing it to Simon Magus3 in
Ireland, those of the same way of thinking, found a heathen origin, by tracing
it to the swine-herd of King Loegaire mac Neill (ΑΙ). 428-463). The one
fiction can be no more credible than the other, as the universality of the
custom proves ; traces of it were to be found even on the Continent during the
sixth and seventh centuries (Vide Tripartite Life of St. Palrick, p. 509).

2 Subulcmn : this word is regarded by some as a proper name, whereby the
originator of the Irish tonsure is made to be Subulcus, a son of King Loegaire,
instead of his swine-herd. Filii, however, stands here for mac=Welsh map.
According to the Book of Amnaglz (c. 9), this heathen king, who remained a
heathen, notwithstanding his formal conversion, reigned at Tara, when St.
Patrick visited him and performed many wonders in his presence. In the
Analecta Bollandz'czna (i, 5 5 5), the name is printed Lozgm're nonlinefilz'us Neill.
