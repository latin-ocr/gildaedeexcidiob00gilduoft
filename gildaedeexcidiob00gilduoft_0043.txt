ruined to the ground 3 they found, construet, and complete basilicae

in honour of the holy martyrS, and set them forth in many places

as emblems of victory; they celebrate feast days; the sacred

offices they perform with clean heart and lip ; all exult as children

members continued, until the Arian unbelief, fierce as a snake
vomiting forth upon us its foreign poison, caused deadly separation
between brethren dwelling together. In this way, as isa path were

10 made across the sea, all manner of wild beasts began to inject
with horrid mouth the fatal poison of every form of heresy, and to
inflict the lethal wounds of their teeth upon a country always
wishful to hear something new and, at all events, desiring nothing
steadfastly.

bursting forth soon into an immense forest, the island retained the
Roman name, but not the morals and law ; nay rather, casting forth
