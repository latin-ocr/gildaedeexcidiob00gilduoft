restore the ravished lady. Accordingly, she who was to be restored,
was restored in peace and good will. When these things were done,
the two kings gave to the abbot a gift of many domains ; and they
came to visit the temple of St. Mary and to pray, while the abbot
5 confirmed the beloved brotherhood in return for the peace they
enjoyed and the benefits which they had conferred, and were more
abundantly about to confer. Then the kings returned reconciled,
promising reverently to obey the most venerable abbot of Glastonia,
and never to violate the most sacred place nor even the districts
10 adjoining the chief’s seat.

1 2 When he had obtained permission from the abbot of Glastonia
and his clergy and people, the most devout Gildas desired to live
again a hermit's life upon the bank of a river close to Glastonia,
and he actually accomplished his object. He built a church there

Ι5 in the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity, in which he fasted
and prayed assiduously, clad in goat's hair, giving to all an
irreproachable example of a good religious lise. Holy men used
to visit him from distant parts of Britain, and when advised,
returned and cherished with delight the encouragements and

20 counsels they had heard, from him.

13 He fell sick at last, and was weighed down with illness. He
summoned the abbot of Glastonia to him, and asked him, with
great piety‚ when the end of his life had come, to cause his body to
be borne to the abbey of Glastonia, which he loved exceedingly.

25 When the abbot promised to observe his requests, and was grieved
at the requests he had heard, and shed copious tears, St. Gildas,
being now very ill, expired, while many were looking at the angelic
brightness around his fragrant body, and angels were attending
upon his soul. After the mournful words of commendation were

30 over, the very light body was removed by the brethren into the
abbey; and amid very loud wailing and with the most befitting
funeral rites, he was buried in the middle of the pavement of St.
Mary's church ; and his soul rested, restS, and will rest, in heavenly
repose. Amen.

14 Glastonia was of old called Ynisgutrin, and is still called so by
the Eritish inhabitants, Ynis in the British language is insula in

 

by Caradoc's time, might have been Vz'lrimts originally, while w'lr-eus could
hardly have become ‚quir-in in Welsh. Ym's Gulrin, or Jm's lViI‘rin, the
British name for the land granted in 601 to the Church of Glastonbury‚ would
thus mean the lslaml of Gulrin, or Gm'trin,· that the name ‘⁴ Glastonz'a‚⁷² or
Glczslonbmy, has nothing to do with glass (from welsh gtcffldr) is evident‚
