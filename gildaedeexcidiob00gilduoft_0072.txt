2 Ambrosio Aureliano. Ambrosius Aurelian has become known in 11”81511
literature as Em1·ys XVIedig, or, as the Historia Britamcm gives the name,
Embreis Culetic. According to Gildas, he is (Ι) a Romanus, a member of one
of the few old aristocratic families then remaining in Britain 3 (2) his ancestors
had worn the imperial purple z he may have been a descendant of some tyrannus
that had assumed the title of Augustus in Britain ; (3) he vias a vir modestus,
which implies kindness os disposition with unassuming manners : the mention

of this quality goes far to prove that the information had come to Gildas fiom
some one personally acquainted with the victorious leader 3 (4) his descendants,

grandchildren probably, were intimately known to Gildas. 11551181·(Αηίίᾳιιίίῐιῆτ,
vol. v, c. xiii p. 513) has drawn attention to the false reading indutus forindnlis,
which the first edition of Polydore Vergil introduced. In this way Ambrosius
Aurelian himself assumed imperial power ‘⁸ for the struggle” (collisioni for col-
lisione) against the Saxons. But, though one codex⁷ A, reads inclusus, the way
in which Beda paraphrases Gildas shows plainly that he must have read
indutis: occisis in cadem j>‹n·e7tlil›us regium nonten et insigne serentibus.
H. li, i, 16. With Beda agrees the Historia Britonum of Nennius, which
makes Ambrosius say that his father was of consular rank (c. 42). The Irish
version of Nennius adds an interpretation os Galeria, in Latin, as meaning king
qsllte lfrssons (rar Brilonum). Maximus is also styled Maxim (31118118 (Archiv
fiir c‘elt. lauricogn, i., s. 206), but, in the case of 110111, its implication appears
to he that osa commander. Geoffrey of Moumouth absurdly makes him 1118
son 01⁴ the tyrannus Constantine, whom he represents as king of Britain, along
with Constans the monk and Uthur ben dragon: “Ac or wreic bonno y bu
idaw tri 1118111. Sef oed y rei hynny, Constans ac Emrys Wledic ac Uthur ben
dragon ’³ (Brun, p. 126). We seem to have here a reminiscence os both Gildas
