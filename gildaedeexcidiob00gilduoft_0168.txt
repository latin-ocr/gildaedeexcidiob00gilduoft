¹ Ad se. The meaning of se, preceded by eins, is fixed by the LXX,
ὡς μεγάλη ἡ ἐλεημοσύνη τοῦ κυρίου,
καὶ ἐξιλιισμὸς τοῖς ἐπιστρέφουσιν ἐπ’ αὐτόν.

2 Et si non lmbemns . . . This sentence is a good instance of the vein of real
modesty which runs through this work ; it does not in any way impress us as the
empty mannerism bf conventional sels-depreciation. Gildas halts with modest
sels-sear at the saying: “ Ι 00111(1 wish that I were anathema from Christ for my
brethren's sake ;'’ but with a full heart (toto corde) he can use other words, such as
those of the prophet Micah : “Alasl a soul is pe1·ishing.” There is earnest
grief 111 these touching words of that prophet whose mission it was to rebuke
the moral condition of both people and princes. The reality of modest
afl‘ectionate sorrow, on the part of Gildas, for those addressed by him is clear,
:md it leads us to look at other words of his which will all the more be felt to have
the same ring· os sincerity. “ Constrained by my own reasonings or by the pious

indeed poor 3 but, as I think, it is faithful and friendly to every disciple of Christ,
though weighty and hard to bear, for foolish apostates'' (c. 1). We call to mind
also his anxiety to help men to carry the burden he bringS, by words of
encouragement and consolation (consolatorio (fiala) (c. 62). ‘⁶ Me, poor though
l am, thou holdest of no moment, and yet Ι observe the prophet's word with
cai-nest affectionateness of souF' (0. 36). “ Surelyl shall put forth what Ι scel :
