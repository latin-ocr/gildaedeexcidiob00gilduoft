The Ruz'n of Britain. 2 19

the heavenly Father is so far from being praised that he is unbear-
ably blasphemed. Ι could indeed wish that these testimonies of
Holy Scripture inserted in this epistle, or to be inserted, as far as
my mean power would be able, should all be interpreted in a

94 historical or moral sense. But in order not to extend this little
work to too great a length for those men who despise, scorn and
turn aside, not so much my words as God’s, the passages have
been, or will be, put together without any paraphrase. A little
further on ε For whosoever shall break one of these least command- Matt. ν, 19.

10 ments ancl shall teaclc men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of
heaven. Again : sndge not that ye be not jndged, for with wlmt Matt. vii, 1, 2.
ficagrementyejudge z't shall bejuassged to yon. Who of you, Ι ask, will
have regard to that which follows : Bnt why beholdest thou the mole Matt. vii, 3, 4.
z'n thy brother‘s eye, and considerest not the beaw in thz'ne own eye ,Ρ Or

15 how sayest thon to thy brother: Let me cast the mote ont of thz‘ne
eye ,· and lo ,Ι the beant is in thz'ne own eye. Or what follows ε Gz‘ve Matt- vii. 6·
not that which is holy nnto the dags, neither cast yonr pearls before
swz'ne, lest haply they trample them under their feet and turn and
rend yon. This very frequently happens to you. Admonishing

20 the people lest they be seduced by crafty teachers, such as you are,
he said: Beware of false prophets, which come to yon z'n sheep's Matt. vii,
clothz'ng, bnt inwardly are ravenz'ng wolves. By their frnz'ts ye shall 15-17'
know them. Do men guther grapes os thorns, or figs of thz'stles?
Even so every good tree beoreth goodfrnz’t, and a corrupt tree corrupt

25 fruit. And below : Not every one that saith nnto me, Lord, Lord, Matt. vii, 21·
shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, bnt he that doeth the will of my
Father which is z'n heaven, the same shall enter into the kingdom of

95 heaven. What indeed shall become of you who, as the prophet Isaiae xxix, 13·

says, cling to God with your lips only, not with your heart? But

30 how do you fulfil what follows: Behold I send yon as sheep in the Matt. x. 16.
midst of wolva, you who, on the contrary, go as wolves in a flock of
sheep? Or that which is said by him ; Be ye therefore wz'se as serpents Man. x, 16·

 

in the eyes of Gildas, as when he explains words of the Sermon on the Mount
to be spoken to ‘⁴ crafty teachers '⁷ and “ depraved bishops.” He is now correct-
ing or restraining himself, so as not any further to mix his own words with
those of Scripture, and so extend the length of his booklet (opusculum), for
the readers he has in view. The work, which he modestly called in c. 1 an
admom‘nncnla, is, with the same implication, now termed a “ letter '² (epistola),
and the epithet used of the contents of cc. 27-36‚ viZ. : “ the tearful and plaintive
narrative of the evils of this age ’² <flebilis querelaque malorum aevi huius
historia), serves aptly to connect the supposed two parts, thus making the whole
one book„
