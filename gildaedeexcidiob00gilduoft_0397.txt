the refectory‚ he gave the inmates a restless night. XVhen a
servant had gone for a small vessel, which had been placed near
full of wine, he found it empty ; but no trace was found where the

When he came and heard from the brethren of the phantasms
they had endured on the previous night, he took water with
some salt, blessed it, and sprinkled it round about ancl inside;
