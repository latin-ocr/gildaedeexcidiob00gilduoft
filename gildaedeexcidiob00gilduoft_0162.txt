PART IV.

THE second principal division of the work begins here. Perhaps, judging by
references made to Gildas, it might be held that the sole interest os what he has
written is at an end with c. 63, so that the portion now beginning has but small
claims upon the notice of a student of history. It is true that this part is
concerned chiefly with what might be termed Ecclesiastical Britain ; it is an
appeal, in the foremost place, to the bishops os Britain, and, in a secondary, to
the rest of the clergy ; there is no allusion to any secular ruler‚ nor hardly to
the people, except as sufferers at the hands of unworthy ministers of the Church.
Nevertheless, I feel that a truer estimate of the former half can be gained
by a close study of this second half. The work is one piece, and allusions
are made here to words used by the writer in the earlier parts of his work. His
niessage to princes and judges, on the whole, is less sels-contained than his
message to his brother clergy, and, on that account, one feels that in his
delivery of the second, Gildas, as a writer, stands upon a higher level. In aim
and execution, the second portion is probably superior to the first. The dark
picture, there, of cruelty and immorality, serves as a background for the darker
picture here. Yet those tender touches, obserx'ed in his appeals to the princes,
are even more frequent here. “ Repent, I pray, and corne to Christ,'’ he says
to one of his princes, “though thou labourest and art bent by thy heavyload ;
He, according to His word, will give thee rest. Come to Him, who willeth
not the sinner’s death, but that he turn and live.'' In this part, he frankly
confesses that his language is not as lenient as it might be, yet the invitations
to a changed life are frequent3 his utterance‚ he confesses‚ is wrung from a
wounded heart (quod non absque dolore cordis faleor).

If we were to ask the question, whether the work was in any way
successful, Ι should feel inclined to reply‚ that there are many reasons

for an affirmative answer. But, whilst the reader may be referred to the
Introduction as to a detailed account of the grounds for this conclusion,
it may be stated here that the success of the whole was due chiefly to this

second part. Gildas seems certainly lo leave gained the ear ef the clergy,·
a new age begins frorn his time in the British and Irish Churches. This
book may well have been but part of a great propaganda, already at work,
and issuing from the school of Illtud; the friends by whose persuasion‚ as
he tells us in the first chapter, his task was undertaken‚ were also zealously
aiding his efforts. Therefore we find that the British “Saints'' are of the
sixth century, contemporaries and successors of Gildas, with a shadowy
older figure or two, such as Dubricius and Paulinus, preceding them; in
Ireland, the men who filled it with monasteries‚ Finian of Clonard, Brendan,
Kieran, Comgall, and otherS, are, by a very wide tradition, closely connected
with Gildas and his younger friends. Finian, the founder of Clonard, had been
a disciple os “the three holy men, Dewi, Cathmael and Gildas‚’' at Kilmuine
(Cilffnynyw) ι llrendan, who founded Clonfert, and Kieran (Cieran) the founder
osCloninacnois, were brought up at Clonard, but Brendan is also represented
