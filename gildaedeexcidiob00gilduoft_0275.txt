Fragments from Lost Lelters. 263

IV. OF MONKS, GILDAS SAYS : Those who come frorn a
meaner monastery to a more perfect—from one whose abbot has so
far degenerated from God’s work that he deserves not to be received
to the table of saints, but to be accused of the crime of fornication,

,ς not as a matter of suspicion but of patent evil—such monks
receive to you, without scruple, as men fleeing from the flame of
hell, holding no consultation whatever with their abbot. Those,
however, whose abbot we do not exclude from the table of the
saints because of evil report‚ we ought not to receive against his

10 will. How much more ought we not to receive those coming from
abbots that are holy, and in no other way suspect except that they
possess cattle and carriageS, either because of the custom of their
country or their own weakness, things which do less injury to their
owners, if it be with humility and patience, than to those who hold

15 ploughs and fix mattocks in earth with prejudice and pride.

ITEM—When the ship is wrecked,who can swim, let him swim.

But whatever superabundance there be of worldly things to a
monk, must be referred to luxury and wealth; and what he is driven
to possess by necessity, not by choice, so that he shall not fall into

20 want, will not be counted to him for evil. For the principal orna-
ments of the body, belonging to the head, ought not to scorn the
inferior ones, and it is not right for the constant utilities of the
hands to be haughty towards the higher things. Is it not the case,

theless the time was naturally productive also of great diversity and gradation
os reputed “pe1·fection,'' and the fervour which caused it stamped out the
indolent bad abbot‚ by countenancing desertion on the part of his monks.

³ Quanto magis. One seems to find here a wise moderation on the part of
Gildas‚ wherein he does not yield to the excessive growing strictness that may
have prevailed in some quarters. There existed suspicion of some abbots,
because they performed their journeys riding, or in carriages, instead of bare-
footed‚ with the simple staff. But Gildas is willing to make concessions upon
the ground of habit or weakness, so that monks who deserted abbots upon such
pleas as these were not to be received into the better (perfectior) monastery.

ITEM, ETC. Only found in Hibernensz's .· there it immediately follows
superbia.

4 Quicquid . . . . reputabitur. This sentence appears in Hib„ xxxv, 5, where
it bears the title : ⁸‘ That a monk should have no individual property '' (De e0,
quod non oportet monachum habere proprium).

The next sentence respecting bishops (summi-sacerdotes), proves that the
man to whom Gildas wrote these words was bishop as well as monk. It has
been pointed out that Finnian of Clonard is not called bishop 3 Finnian of
Moville was abbot and bishop : a fact that has been regarded as confiiming the
view that he was Gildas⁷ correspondent.
