¹ Ecclesiastica historia narrat. Under this term we are to understand the
Latin version of Eusebius’ Historia Ecclesz‘astim, by Rufinus. But the mention
of“ ecclesiastical history'’ suggests the very question that has been asked by
several. Scholl was probably the first to suggest that Gildas is here adopting
the description he found in Eusebius of the Diocletian persecution, and
applying the same to Britain. But this chapter is in fact not a descrzption ο]
βινέιίᾙίίιυι in Brz‘lczz'n; it rather describes what took place “over the whole
world‘⁷ (per tolzzm mundum), and as such is a resume' of Book VIII in Eusebius’
llislmy. The actual course of events is followed by Gildas, just as the edicts
succeeded each other, and as described by Eusebius in the second chapter of
the book namedssthe ruin of churches, burning of Scriptures‚ slaughter of
Christians. Further, when the final step was taken by the emperors in the
issue of the fourth Edict, the real object had become (as here stated by Gildas)
the extermination of Christianity. It is hardly just to say: “Gildas'generzll
statement respecting this persecution rests (as usual with him) upon an
ullazllllm‘l'scd lrcmsserenre lo the parficular case ef Britain of llze [anglia-ge os
Eusebius (ll. li„ viii, 2) relalz'ng lo llce persecusion in general, and is conclusively
conlradl'cled by Eusebius himself and by Sozomen and Lactantius’⁷ (Haddan
and stubbs, Councds, i, p. 6, nu). The last italics are mine: but this is what
Gildas does nol do in this part ; 110 15 simply summarising what “ Ecclesia-vtica
llsstoriffl narrates 105110011111,Γ the church in general. His definite references
10 Britain are moderate. (Vide next note.)

Besides the places named in Eusebius, one might consult the De Alorte
Persecutorum of Lactantius; and, in addition to the notes of Heinichen
(pp. 381, 405) on 1110 former, Mason on The Persecztlt'on os Diocletimz, 0115. ν
and vi, and the notes in McGiffert's translation of Eusebius, pp. 325, 397.

² Ul conicimus. These words imply that Gildas had no definite infor—
ination respecting the exact time of the inartyrdoms mentioned in this section.
'l'he reading os Codex x, ul cognoscimus, is evidently a gloss, echoing the fixed
tradition of the copyist’s 01111 time. That the martyrdom of St. Alban took
phu-e during the Diocletian persecution is, therefore, a guess on the part of
(iildas. Ile evidently found the narrative given here in some lost Acta or
l'aeessio, and 110 find that Beda has added other details from some second Acta
