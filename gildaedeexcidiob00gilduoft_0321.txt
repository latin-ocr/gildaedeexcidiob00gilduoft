⁶ Gz'ngis. The Leyden Lorica (v, 4) has the same word in a slightly
different formhgzgmzs, but almost in the same connection with other parts of the
body as here. Dr. Stokes renders the Irish gloss by “the chins,⁷² or, as he
understands it, “the double chin '⁷ (aux deux mentons, ou, aux mentons>. Dr.
V. H. Friedel, in the Zez'tsclzr. fiir Celt. Plcz‘lologie, ii, 1, where the Leyden
Lorica is printed, suggests another interesting explanation. In Cormac (9th
Cent.) gin signifies mouth, and is derived a gzugris in the sense of ‘⁴ openings’' :
gingae-—only in plural—is in this way to be understood of “the two jaws‚⁷’ both
of which, by a common error, a toutes les epoques, are supposed to open.
Allusion is made to certain rare Greek words; Hesychius, for instance,
explains γίγγλυλος as a join in a door or abutment, and “a kind of kiss '² (καὶ
φιλήματος εἶδος); the verb γιγγλυμοῦμαι is employed by Hippocrates of limbs,
joining, and γιγγλυμωτός by mathematicians of like “joins.'' The two jaws, if
regarded as moving upon hinges, make “ openings,” and we have gingis in a
sense differentiated from maxillis.

⁷ Anele (= abelae) : anile C, anale N, but K anhelae. The forms am'llus
anilus, anillae, are found in Gregory of Tours, with the meaning of breath.
Du Cange.

8 Sublingue : Sublinguae C with gloss buugedrum : operculum gurgulionis,
quasi parva lingua, quae foramen linguae recludit operitve. Isidore, Etyma,
xi, 59. Isidore writes sublinguium, which is glossated sublingua.
