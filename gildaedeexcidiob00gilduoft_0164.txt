1 52 De Excidio Britanniae.

priests and altars, it may be well to endeavour to form an idea what manner
of man a bishop of the sixth century might have been in Britain. We shall
make this attempt so as to prevent our coming to Gildas with ideas derived
from modern times, or even from media-val, or worse still, from primitive
Christian times. The subject will, no doubt, be too familiar to several who may
read these pages ; but one feels convinced that there are others who cherish a
passionate interest in the history of the past, for whom it will be an advantage
to be placed, if possible, in a proper, position to read the terms found in this
part of Gildas, as they were understood in his time.

VVhatever theory be held respecting the rise of the episcopate in the Church,
it will be universally conceded that, between A.D. 150 and A.D. 200, monarchic
episcopacy had become the rule throughout all Christendom. By this is meant,
that about the time mentioned, no Church, as far as history knows, regarded the
regular ministry of the Church except as consisting of bishop, presbyters and
deacons. That‚1n0reover‚ by about 200-25o‚ it had become customary to regard
all bishops as priests also, will, I believe, be accepted everywhere ; but it was
not customary until the time of Jerome (340-420), and Augustine (354-430)‚ to
give the title of priest (sacerdos) to presbyters as well as bishops. From about

A.D. 400, in round numbers, priesthood (sacerdolimn) was thus regarded as a holy
function of both orders, and yet frequently the term priest was applied juzr

eminence, and without qualification, to the bishop alone.

ln this book, a work of the sixth century, we accordingly find bishops,
presbyters and deacons in great numbers, and further, the presbyteral chair, as
well as the episcopal, is a priest’s chair (sacerdotalis sedes>3 all the bishops
hold the “apostolic see,'' because every bishop is a “successor of Peter 3⁷³ they
are successors of the Apostles ; they, together with the presbyters, have power
to bind and loose ; authority to pronounce absolution belongs to the two orders.
Being priests, they have, as such, altar and sacrifice ; 111 Britain it is just as in
Gaul ; the same ideas prevail here as elsewhere.

Gildas is silent as to any distinctions of authority among bishops, and there
are weighty reasons sor concluding that the Metropolitan system had, at that
time, no place in Britain. Moreover, his words in reference to the large
number of bishops‚ “ if not too many, certainly not too feW,'' and what is known
from other sources respecting the subsequent history os the Church in Ireland,
imply that ‘⁶ Diocesan'' episcopacy did not prevail among the Britons in his
time. This means that every separate community, or a very small group of
chin-(hes, had its own bishop3 it would have as well its own presbyters and
deacons; Gildas does not mention the so-called minor erdem, sub-deacons,
acolytes, exorcists‚ lectors‚ ostiarii, though they seem to be implied in the words
quemlibet gradum (C. 66).

We find that there was used in the Gallie and Spanish Churches‚ during
the second half of the fifth century and the sixth‚ a short body or digest of
church rules or canons, called Statum Ecclesiae Antiqsz Maassen, in his
Cosa-hicme der Quellen und der Lileralm' des canonisslten Res-lits, i, 382—304,
has given a very full account of this interesting collection, concluding that it
