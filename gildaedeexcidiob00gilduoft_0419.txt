space osone year 3 and on being requested, he superintended them
most advantageously, receiving no see from the scholars except the
prayers of the clergy and scholars. And there he himself wrote out
the work 01 the four evangelistS‚ a work which still remains in the
5 church of St. Cadoc, covered all over with gold and silver in

honour of God, of the holy writer, and of the Gospels. The
inhabitants 01 VVales hold this volume as a most valuable possession

in their oaths, and neither dare open it in order to look into it,
nor confirm peace and friendship between hostile parties, unless it

10 be present, specially placed there for the purpose.

9 At the close of the year, and when the scholars were retiring
from study, the saintly abbot Cadoc and the excellent master,
GildaS, mutually agreed ‘to repair to two islandS‚ viz„ Ronech and
Echin. Cadoc landed In the one nearer to VValeQ and Gildas in

15 the one that lies over against England. They were unwilling to
be hindered in the church offices by the conflux of men; and, on
this account, they could think of no better plan than to leave the
valley of Carvan and resort to the secrecy osan island. Gildas
founded there an oratory in honour of the holy and indivisible

20 Trinity‚ and close to it was his bed-chamber. It was not in it, how-
ever, that he had his bed, but placed upon a steep cliff, where, upon
a stone, he lay until midnight, watching and praying to Almighty
God. Then he would enter the church quite faint with cold ; but,
for God’s sake, the cold was sweet and endurable to him. He used

25 to take some small fish in a net, and eggs from birds' nests ; and it

 

of Gilda53 but with a grave doubt, at the same time, that a pious belief had
fallen into error.

Had this codex been preserved it would probably be found to contain
Jerome's Latin version, but with many “mixed'’ readings, derived from the
older version that had been used in Britain until the very time of Gildas'
training under Illtud <see p. 92 on the time of the introduction of the Vulgate
into Britain).

appears in the Book (gf Llanddvj . . . . ynys Eclmi bet aper 'sym' (p. 135),
which is translated, “along the Severn Sea by the island 01 Echni as far as the
estuary of the Towy'' (p. 368). So also, in a passage previously quoted, Gildas
is spoken of in the szfe of Oudoceus as in insula Eclmz' ducens anchorz'talem
vitam (p. 139). The Life of Cadoc is silent as to Gildas, but relates that the
former saint used to spend the days 01 Lent on two islands, Bas‘rcn et Eclmz'
(c. 15), and tells also 01 his crossing with two disciples “from Echni, qzez' modo
Holma vocatur, to the island of Barren'' (c. 25). Echni (=Holma) is now
called the Flat Holm. For Barren we should probably read Barna.
