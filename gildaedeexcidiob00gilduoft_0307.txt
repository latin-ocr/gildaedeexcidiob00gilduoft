The Lorz'ca of Gildas. 295

To me, as I read our Lorica, one special difficulty presents
itself with great force, which seems to militate against a date so
early as the middle of the sixth century for its composition. Ideas
and usages have had their periods of development in the long
history of the Church ; and in connection with this gradual growth,
the branch called History of Doctrine has always something to
tell us. Now, in the Lorica os Gz'ldas we find all the so-called
“nine grades '' of heavenly powers invoked save one; invocation
of all save one (a different power) will be found in the Leyden
Lorica also; between them we have the whole nine. The Lorz'ca
of Gz'ldas, according to the text of the Leablzar Breac, expressly
mentions the novem ordines sanctorum angelorum, vv. 55, 56, but
these two lines are omitted in all the five other MSS. known,
which leads us to suspect a late addition here at least; the same
is true of the previous mention of gradus angelorum, vv. 29, 30,
31, 32, so that the same suspicion also attaches to those verses.
Yet the names of the eight grades mentioned are entwined in the
structure of the Hymn throughout eleven lines of the First Part
(vv. 13-24)‚ and therefore it must have been common in Britain,
sometime about 540-550, for men to invoke angelic powers and
saints in prayer ; for the saints also are here in the usual order—
patriarchS, prophetS‚ apostles‚ martyrs, virgins, viduae, confessors.
ln contrast with this definite detailed enumeration, we place the fact
that no Western writer previous to Gregory the Great had written
about the nine grades of angels,1 or with any fulness, as he, of the
intercessory powers of the saintly dead.2 Of course, one sees the
usage of prayersfor the dead, ancl prayers addressed to those who
had been conspicuous sor sanctity or fortitude in suffering,
becoming common during the fourth century. Christian poetry
became a strong propagator of the idea; Ambrose of Milan had
introduced the angels as objects of invocation : “ obsecrandi sunt
angeli pro nobis, qui nobis ad praesidium dati sunt, martyres
obsecrandi‚'’ etc., De Vz'duz's, 9. Yet, until the Greek mysticism of
the writings of Dionysius had become known in the great
Monophysite controversy of the fifth century, we do not find the

 

Novem vero angelorum ordines diximus3 quia videlicet esse, testante
sacro eloquio, scimus angelos, archangelos, virtutes, potestates, principatus,
dominationes, thronos, cherubim atque seraphim.—H0mil. Lib. ii, Hom.
xxxiv, 7.

² Adsunt defensores nostri sancti martyres, rogari volunt, atque, ut ita
dixerim, quaerunt ut quaerantur. Hos ergo adiutores vestrae orationis quaerite:
hos protectores vestri reatus invenite.—H0mil. Lib. ii, Hom. xxxii, 9.
