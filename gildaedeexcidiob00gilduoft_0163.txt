PART IV.

as betaking himself for more advanced training to Gildas in Wales ; Comgall,
the founder of Bangor, and master of Columbanus, falls into the same line
by his early connection with Clonmacnois.

1. There is one contribution, in way of historical evidence, furnished us by
this division that deserves very special mention. Every page, almost every
chapter from c. 65 to the end is full of references to the ministry of the Church
as such. We read much of bishops, presbyters, priests, altars and preaching,
but only an apologetic allusion to Monasticism in words that more than half
disguise their true meaning. Here is certainly a very marked feature3 in
this specially ecclesiastical portion of the work, there is found no mention of
Monasticism as part of the public life of Christianity in this island. But that
Christianity which is rightly regarded as possessing a peculiarly Celtic stamp,
and which we connect in our thoughts with these islands, is one having the
monastery as the centre of both its religious activity and its government. For
it, the abbot is more important than the bishop: the cloister, with fresh
accretions derived from native customs, absorbs the ecclesia. It becomes,
however, very evident as we read these pages that the Church, of which and to
which Gildas writes, is in no way organised after this model ; we find it to be a
Church having the customary episcopal constitution. There is no lack of material
for understanding what the ecclesiastical development had become elsewhere,
or was becoming, during the sixth century ; therefore it is a matter of no small
moment to find that in Britain, so far as the evidence of this work goes, we
have at that time a Church of the same type as elsewhere, only somewhat
more antiquated. We are thus able to infer tluzt she dislinclivehs Celtic type
os Clzurclz must luzve been developed subsequently to c. ΑΒ. 540. Gildas will
probably witness its rise and growth, after years of toil 3 he shall see it, but not
yet ; he himself is one of the builders of the new fabric.

2. We observe that no complaint is uttered by the writer, in respect of
schism, or any peculiarity of ritual. It is true that schism is once mentioned,
just as Novatus is alsonamed, yet there is nothing to lead us into a suspicion
of separation from the Catholic Church beyond the fact that individual
men, proud and unscrupulous, who return home from abroad, themselves as
nova quaedam plasmata, had been irregularly ordained. N either can one find
any trace of heresy in these pages, so that the Church is in the enjoyment of
rest and quiet in this respect, as well as of the outward peace which followed
the siege of Badon Hill. Gildas, had he found it necessary to inveigh against
aberrations of doctrine or canonical irregularities, would have proved, no doubt,
a far more interesting writer: his name would have been surrounded by a
cloud of commentators, and every sentence in his book would have formed
the text of disquisstions, marking peculiar currents of thought, or type of
irregularities. He is, however, a writer whose sole aim is to stimulate the
inner and spiritual life ; he is, therefore, in some sense, uninteresting. But as
in this part there occurs such frequent mention of bishops and presbyters, of
