sounded mystical. But l may refer the reader to the notes on
pp. 306-308.

Greek words also, in rude Latin transcription, appear in all,
such as, somata (σώματα), troni (θρόνοι), pe pompe) (πέπομπα),
ngrrus (μικρός), pantes, pantia (πάντες, πάντα), basium, basibus
(βάσεων, βάσεσιν), pella (πέλτη), ceplzale (κεφαλήν) as neuter, batlmza
(βαθμοί) ; such terms as antlzletas or anatlzletas, agonetetas, proretas,
would be familiar from the service os the Church, continued for
several centuries in South Gaul1 in that language, and, as we have
good reason to believe, by Gildas himself in Wales.

Some common peculiarities cannot be regarded as “Hisperic
Latin,'’ such as neuter plurals of the second and third declensions
treated as if they were feminines, e.g.‚ cruras, as if from crura
instead of crus, and „veniam from the neut. pl. senia, treated as fem.
singular: copious instances of such forms will be found in the
Critical Notes to the Oxford edition of the Vulgate. Ronsch's
pages also plainly show us that this is not peculiar to Celtic
Latinity (Itala u. Vulgata, 259, 269: Call. Plnl, Codex D, 130).
Codex D, for example, has regularly retia, retiae, retiam, etc„ as
though retia were fem. singular. This usage is peculiar to the
time when vulgar Latin was abandoning the use of the neuter
gender. Nor can an argument be built on the occurrence of rare
nouns in -men in these documents and ιη Gildas, such as peccamen,
though‘ ‘in the Celtic languageS, both Old· Irish and British
dialects, only peccatum (peclmcl) has survived as loanword; about
thirty such forms are given by R'onsch from various sources——
Tertullian, Arnobius, Augustine, etc. One feels that Zimmer
makes a strong case in his list of words found to be common to
Gildas and these documents with their Hisperic Latin; yet of
some of these we may at once quote parallels, such aS, cespis,
telluris of the Luxernb. Glosses, and in nostro cespite of Gildas
(c. 23 ; also c. 6) with which we compare ibi cespite lerrafecundo of
Jerome, Ep. 14, 1 ε placor, another word mentioned as occurring
in llzkperica Famz‘na and Gildas, occurs twice in the Latin O.T.,
Sirach iv, 13, and xxxix, 23.

I am, I hope, adequately conscious how much is left out or im-
perfectly stated in the above brief account, ² yet Ι can but feel the
justice of Thurneysen’s criticism, that the field is far 'too narrow
