4 2 De Excidio Britanniae.

found the civilised parts of the island empty of proper garrisons to obstruet
their path. It was the best opportunity for robber-inroads.

4. Two Roman expeditioris are mentioned by Gildas as taking place aster
Maximus had carried the forces needed for defence over to Gaul. The brief
account given above will aid us in finding the sermimts a quo for the time
during which these took place. The position of Maximus, though strong, made
it impossible for him to spare any of the old garrisons, much less any other
forces, to take the field in Britain against the Seots and Pictsfl* It may be
concluded, therefore, that no expedition could come until Theodosius had
afresh reorganised the empire, This brings us to the year 389. It is possible
also to fix a lerllll'nus ad quem.

In the last days of December, 406, the Vandals and Alani crossed the
Rhine for a furious attaek upon the rich provinces of Gaul (Wamlali el Halani
Gallias trajecto Rheno ingressi II k. san. Prosper Tiro, M. G. H„ ix, p. 465).
In consequence, great dissatisfaction arose in Britain, where many Gallie de-
tachments were then serving, and moved by sear of a general collapse of the
empire, they proceeded to set up a new emperor. After making trial of several,
they eventually fix on one bearing the noble name of Constantine, οἰηθέντες
καθότι ταύτην εἶχε προσηγορίαν καὶ βεβαίως αὐτὸν κρατήσειν τῆς βασιλείας, Sozom.,
H. E, ix, 11 3 vide also Oros„ vii, 40. ‘⁶ Having perpetrated extensive murder,
they—i.e., the Vandals, Alani and Suabians—became objects of sear even to the
armies serving in Britain, and drove them, through fear of an attack against
themselves, to proceed to the electiori of tyrants such as Marcus and Gratian,
and after these Constantine„ (Zosimus, vi, 3, 1). On this act, Mr. Hodgkin, in
the first volume of Italy and Her Jnvaders, p. 740, remarks: “Where the liege-
men of a constitutional king change a ministry, the subjects of an elected
emperor upset a dynasty.'' The discontented army of Britain was led over to
Gaul in the year 407 by Constantine, the third tyrannus, of whose deeds a full
account by Dr. Freeman will be found in the English Hz'storical Review, 1886,
in his article on “Tyrants of Britain, Gaul and Spain,'’ or in the above-named
work of Mr. Hodgkin. At no time, therefore, in the year 407, or subsequently,
could any detachment of Roman forces be sent over to Britain, because this
usurpation of Constantine, with his four years of power over the Prefecture
of the Gauls, was the beginning of the final abandonment. ‘⁴ It was not Britain
that gave up Rome, but Rome that gave up Britain.’' By A.D. 446, we know from
Cildas, there were hardly any of the old Roman families left in the island.

Between 383 and 389, as has been said, no succour by the empire could
have been despatched to Britain ; from 388-9 onwards order and authority were
being restored in the XVest by Theodosius the Creat, and continued until 406 or
407. This is, therefore, the interval during which the two expeditions men-
tioned by Gildas must have taken place, that is, a period of about eighteen
years (AD. 389-407). It would be natural that Theodosius, while reorganising
Italy and the Prefecture of the Gauls, after the defeat and execution of

Maximus, should not delay in sending succour to Britain. It is certainly
‹lifficult to find definite evidence of such assistance. Socrates mentions

'k St. Ambrose reminds Maximus, in the second embassy, of the latter’s
project to enter Italy “followed by barbarian battalions⁷' (barbarorum stipatus
agminibus, Ep. 24).
