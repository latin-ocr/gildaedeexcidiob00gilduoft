I. Presbiter aut diaconus faciens fornicationem naturalem sive
sodomitam prelato ante monachi voto III annis peniteat,2 veniam
omni hora roget, superpositionem3 faciat in unaquaque ebdomada
exceptis L diebus post passionem4: pane sine mensura et ferculo 5
aliquatenus butiro inpingato die Dominico, ceteris vero diebus
paxmati panis mensura et miso parvum inpinguato, horti holeri-
bus, ovis paucis, Britannico formello utatur, himina Romana lactis

¹ In the book of Columbanus we have a similar beginning, Incipit de poeni-
tentia .· the title POENITENTIALE VINNIAI precedes that of Vinnian (or
Finnian). The first rule refers to monks who have been ordained as pres-
byters or deacons ; it is strange that we have no provision sor bishops.

2 peniteat. Penance, as understood in these rules, consists in exclusion from
church communion for a specified period3 it involved severe fasting, or a
reduced regimen of food and drink for a given period of time, sometimes also
the recitation of a number of Psalms, as prescribed in 22.

³ Superposz'lz'mlem. Supmssosilio, or more fully superpositio ieiunii, means
the prolongation of a fast, whether on the same day or by the addition of
another day, The term was specially applied to the prolongation of the Friday
fast to Saturday3 by Tertullian this usage is called continuare ieiunitas-z (De
icium„ 14), and the usage was observed at Rome above all places. The well-
known saying of Ambrose to Augustine's mother, quoted by her son in the
letter to Canmlanus, had reference to this observance of Saturday as an added
fast z “XVhen l am here (at Milan), I do not fast : when I am at Rome, Ι fast,
on Saturday⁷' (Ep. xxxvi). The Spanish Synod of Elvira (AD. 300> seems to
limit the observance os such sufimssositlo at the end of the week, to a monthly
obseiwance, as we see from Canon XXIII ; by so doing, and by another Canon
(XXVI), it seems to have abrogated the weekly szssmssosz'lso.

“ ieiunii superpositiones per singulos menses placuit celebrari, exceptis
diebus duorum mensium, Julii et Augusti, propter quorundam infirmitatem.''—
Can. xxm.

‘⁶ Errorem placuit corrigi, ut omni sabbati die superpositiones celebremus.''
—Cam xxvl.

The fact is deserving of notice, as it has wider bearings, that at Milan, in
