26 De Excidio Britanniae.

caligine Britannia obfuscaretur, clarissimos lampades sanctorum
martyrum nobis accendit, quorum nunc corporum sepulturae et
passionum loca, si non lugubri divortio barbarorum quam plurima
ob scelera nostra civibus adimerentur, non minimum intuentium
inentibus ardorem divinae caritatis incuterent ε sanctum Albanum
verolamiensem, Aaron et Iulium Legionuin urbis cives¹ ceterosque
utriusque sexus diversis in locis summa magnanimitate in acie
Christi perstantes dico.

Quorum prior postquam caritatis gratia confessorem persecutori-

Christum cznimam pro ovibus ponentem domo primum ac mutatis
dein mutuo vestibus occuluit et se discrimini in fratris supra dicti

 

Lact. De illorle Pers„ xv : Letter of Donatist bishops to Constantine in Optat.
De Scln'sm. Don„ i, 22 . In his anxiety to exonerate the father of Constantine
the Great, Eusebius may be regarded as having gone too far when he said that he
destroyed none Of the church buildings, μήτε τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν τοὺς οἴκους καθελών.
Lactantius expressly states that the churehes, as mere walls which could be
restored, were pulled down by him, but that he kept intact and safe the true
temple of God, that is, the human body. Nam Constantius, ne dissentire a
maiorum praeceptis videratur, conventicula, id est parietes qui restitui poterant,
dirui passus est ,· verum aulem dei semiplum, quod est in hominibus, incolume
semovit. It must be remembered that Constantius was only Caesar of the
“ parts beyond the Alps,⁷⁷ and that he did not visit Britain until A.D. 306, the year
of his death at York. The Caesar's power was limited, which would render the
name of Maximian as a rabid persecutor, especially after the fourth Edict of 304,
the more potent name with many governors and magistrates. Constantius was
bound to conform to the policy of the Augusti in carrying out edicts which
bore his own name as well as theirs. When, therefore, it is known that many
martyrdoms did take place in Spain, though that country belonged to Con-
stantius, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Britain had witness of the same
sufferings, especially before 306, when he himself arrived in the island. Some
confirmation of this view is afforded by the numerous place-names beginning
with Mei-thir, or Merthyr, found in parts of clamorgan, and more sparsely in
Monmouth and Brecknock. Vide Additional Note after c. 26.

inore is known than is told us here by Gildas. Mason, in The Persecutz‘on of
lum-sclina, p. 146, calls them “two clergymen of Caerleon,'' an epithet the
ius-tirt- of which can neither be proved nor disproved. Dr. l'lulniner (vol. ii, p. 20>
