69 Perhap5‚ however, some one may say : All bishops or presbyters
are not so wicked as they have been described in the former part ;
because they are not defiled by the infamy of schism or of pride

charge of schism, pride, or uncleanness can be advanced. Gildas is not strongly
drawn to deny this 3 on his general attitude towards men of this class, see notes
on p. 154. Schism is nowhere else alluded to, and it seems that the most self-
seeking and immoral among the clergy were well able to keep themselves clear
of this accusation. Gildas has probably been reminded of schism by his
mention of Novatus (Novatian ?)‚ who certainly did foment an unworthy
division, that spread over many parts of Italy and Gaul.
