EZEKIEL (EZECHIEL).

The place assigned by Gildas to Ezekiel, in the series of prophetical books,
is somewhat singular, but seems capable of explanation, satisfactory, it may
be hoped. Reference has already been made to the consolatory intention
of the writer in his use of XVisdom and Ecclesiasticus, as proving that
their position here cannot imply a similar position in his copy or copies of
the Old Testament Scriptures. It is a well-known fact that complete copies
of the Bible were exceedingly rare. Gregory of Tours was just a genera-
tion younger than Gildas, his episcopate extending frorn A.D. 573 to his
death in 5943 and during his lifetime the Bible, we know from his wriffings,
was found in churches in separate volumes. No doubt the whole bibliotheca,
as the term was used for a complete Bible, belonged to every church and
to many individuals, yet he speaks os “three books having been placed on
the altar, id est prophetiae(=the sixteen prophetical books), apostoli <=the
Epistles)‚ atque evangeliorum (=the four Cospels)‚'⁷ Hist. Fr„ iv, 163 also
“three books . . . id est psalterii (book of Psal1ns>; regum (ΣΙ, 2 Samuel;
1, 2 Kings) ; evangeliorum (=the four Gospels),” ib„ v, 14. We can hardly be
wrong· in supposing that the same must have been the case in Britain, so that
the Prophets were included in one, or perhaps in two volumes. By examining

the lists of Biblical books collected by Zahn‚ in ii, 1, of his Gesclzicltte des
Neutest. Kanons, it will be found that the older lists, generally, place the

Prophets as the last books of the Old Testament. They also show that the
twelve Minor Prophets preceded Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and were
regarded as one Book. This arrangement is found in the Apostolic Canons, in
those of the Council of Laodicea, in the Paschal letter of Athanasius, in the
poetic list of Gregory Nazian2‚ in the decisions of the Council of Hippo (AD. 397),
in the list given by Augustine (De doctrina Christiana, ii, 8, 12-14)‚ and in
Cassiodorus' list according to the antiqua translatio. This is the order we have
in Swete's edition of the LXX, vol. iii, as found in the Codex Vaticanus, and
others named in the Presace. The Vulgate introduced a new order, in which
the four greater prophets precede the twelve minor, and this order is found in
other lists quoted by Zahn, such as that of Rufinus, the Decretum Gelasii, and
others. By earlier use and wont, the last two books of the Old Testament for
Gildas would have been Ezekiel, Daniel, or Daniel, Ezekiel, as the order of
succession varies in different lists. But because Gildas does not quote Daniel,
the last book for his series of quotations would be Ezekiel. Now Isaiah and
Jeremiah he quotes from a copy of the Vulgate, and naturally places them in the
position they hold in that version, that is, before the minor prophets ; but when
quoting Ezekiel‚ for sorne reason or other, probably because habit had still too
strong a hold upon his mind, he falls back upon the older version. What, then,
more natural than to place this where it stood in the older codices, vil„ last of

all the Old Testainent books?

We notice the language of Gildas respecting the authorship of these books,
because it leads us to observe that the Church in Britain about 540 was yet
