lee Rm‘n of Britain. 93

completed his forty-third year, about A.D. 540, had seen a time when the
version of Jerome was little, if at all, used in Britain. Then during something
like twenty or thirty years, the New Testament and certain parts of the
Old, had become familiar to the churches in this very version. Might not
this have been, though unrecorded by him, a leading result of the victory at
Badon Hill and the serenitas which followed it?

4. One other point may be mentioned here. This process of the substitution
of one text of the Bible for another would be facilitated by the unpleasant
experience of rival texts existing at the same time. The words of Jerome, in
his Letter to Damasus, as well as those, uttered by him and Augustine, describing
the multiplicity of texts and the confusion that arose out of it, are given in
books on Textual Criticism. The dissatisfaction felt by such men might well
hasten the work of revision, and with many, the reception of the new version.
Gildas suggests to us that Britain had not one, but many, forms of the same
parts of Scripture. The following instances are interesting. Micah iii, 8, is
found in two forms, as follows :—

C. 36. C. 86.

(a) Si non ego implevero fortitudinem (1)) Si non ego implevero fortitudinem
in spiritu et virtute Domini, ut in spiritu Domini et judicio et
enuntiem domui Jacob peccata potestate, ut annuntiem domui
eorum et domui Israhel scelera Jacob impietates suas et Israel
eorum. peccata sua.

The Vulgate reads z Verumtamen ego repletus sum fortititudine spiritus
Domini, iudicio et virtute, ut annunciem Jacob scelus suum et Israel peccatum
suum. Now extract (a) seems to stand midway between (b) and the Vulgate‚
but the closer similarity of (b) to the text of the LXX proves it to be the older.
ἐὰν μὴ ἐγὼ ἐμπλήσω. ἰσχὺν ἐν πνεύματι Κυρίου καὶ κρίματος καὶ δυναστείας τοῦ
ἀπαγγεῖλαι τῷ Ἰακὼβ ἀσεβείας αὐτοῦ, καὶ τῷ Ἰσραὴλ ἁμαρτίας αὐτοῦ.

Hosea viii, 4, is likewise found in a double form :

C. 52. C. 109.
(a) Sibi regnaverunt et non per me. (1)) Fecerunt sibi reges et non per me.
They have reigned for them· Theyhave made unto themselves
selves and not by me. kings and not by me.

The Vulgate is : Ipsi regnaverunt et non exule. The LXX reads : ἑαυτοῖς·
ἐβασιλευσαν καὶ οὐ δι’ ἐμοῦ, which shows that (a) is probably the older ofthe two,
while (1)) almost suggests acquaintance with the HebreW, perhaps, in some
connection that had preceded even Jerome. Cf. Haddan and Stubbs, i, p. 195.

The second chapter of I Samuel presents a strange case. Other quotations
from this book, ten verses in all, as well as six from II Samuel, follow the Vul-
gate, but the six verses quoted from I Samuel ii, have a text so dissimilar that it
must be regarded as Old Latin. Nay, one verse, which is twice quoted by
Gildas, seems to imply differing exemplars even of this. Its double form may
be seen at a glance.

C. 62. C. 76.
eos qui honorant me, honorabo; et et nunc sic dicit Dominus: quoniam
qui me spernunt, erunt ignobiles. qui honorificant me, honorabo eos;

et qui pro nihilo habent me, ad
nihilum redigentur.
