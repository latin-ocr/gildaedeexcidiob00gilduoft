punish crimes and chastise the wicked, that they may not presume
to commit similar sins lest they be similarly punished! But we
believe that through punishment—for God does not twice avenge
the same deed—-that man has been saved by God's mercy.

The festival of St. Gildas—the day on which his body had been
recovered-was approaching: and the people, flowing together
from all quarters, were hastening to celebrate that festive day.
At that time, some man, who had for a long time lain on his bed
laid up with a serious illness, on seeing his friends and neighbours
hurrying to that festival, cried out that they should lead him to
the holy burial·place. For he said that, if he could be worthy to
touch the holy man's grave, he would soon be restored to health :
he kept testifying that this was his belief, that he had this con-
fidence in him. He was consequently brought by his friends, and
placed before the grave of st. Gildas. But as the vigils were
being solemnly celebrated, and he was lying before the sacred
grave, he suddenly stretched himself, and grew stiff like a dead
man : he ceased to wail, his eyes were completely destroyed ; his
hands, feet, and breast grew cold‚ and he seemed to be dead in

lffl‘l'ng me up witlz lzz’s hand? Then, in the sight of all, he rose
up sound in body and rejoicing 3 and bearing a candle in his hand,
he placed it upon the altar 3 and he who in weakness had been led
by the hands of others to the sacred grave, returned home on his
feet, whole and rejoicing. When Ι was afterwards relating this
miracle to some nobles before the church of Plomorcat, that man
was present, and asserted with an oath that the fact was just as I
stated it.

The event became very well known through every part of
Brittany ; 50 that if, in the diocese, or even in any district, mortality
weighed heavily upon the people, its inhabitants fled for refuge to
his most sacred monastery, and waited there without any doubt for
a cure from God. For this same reason a multitude of people used
to come from Ilfintinc; but one of them, named Dongual‚ fell
