Pervenit illud iudicium pro incerto exitu vitae, legentes in
scriptura apostolum perditum cupiditate et latronem confessione
in paradisum translatum.

VII. ITEM.1-C0nepisc0pos autem et conabbates² nec non con-
subiectos non iudicare melius est. Faetentes vero alicuius nequam 5
fama putare nullo modo ad integrum arguant, sed leniter increpent
cum patientia: quos pro conscientia ut possint, debent quasi
suspectos vitare nec tamen ut reos veros excommunicare et mensa
vel pace arcere, cum ratio aliqua necessitatis aut conventus vel
locutionis exegerit, sed illis denuntietur, quod non recte agant, 10
quia non possumus eos pro hoc damnare. Dum communicant illi
indigne, forte nos per cogitationes malas daemonibus communi-
camus. Quos vero scimus sine ulla dubitatione esse fornicatores,
nisi legitimo ordine paeniteant,3 a pace et mensa, cuiuscumque
ordinis legitime fuerunt, arcemus. Ut est illud Si quis frater Ῑ5
nominatur et est form'caszz‘or,4 rel. Et propter principalium vitiorum5
causas evidenter probatas, nulla alia ratione debemus fratres a
communicatione altaris et mensaeG cum tempus poposcerit, arcere.

 

1 Hz'bernensis, i, 16, under the heading: “That none ought to judge bishops,”
from C onepiscopos to melius est.

² Conepiscopos . . . . cmmbbczles. There does not seem to be implied here
any kind of authority on the part of bishops over abbots‚ or of abbots over
bishops. We have simply words dissuasive of overhasty judgment as between
bishops, or abbots, among themselves, contained at first, probably, in some
short sermon.

Hinsc hius mentions that the common use of excommunic-atio becomes
frequent in Frankish times, though the verb appears in the works of Augustine.
(Kirchenrechl, iv, 702, compared with ib. 797). Speaking of the time of Cyprian
Koffman says, excommunicare ist in diesem ersten Periode 56111· selten (s. 73).
Gildas recommends that men over whom even grave suspicion hangs, without
proof of guilt, should not be subjected to excommunication. His words imply
that there was in Britain no common authority over individual bishops or abbots ;
still the implication of excommunication is the same in Britain as among the
churches of the continent. There is exclusion from pax, peace, a word that from
the time ofthe Novatian controversy has a technical meaning ; it means “ church
communion,⁷⁷ or, as found lower in this extract, “communion of the altar ;'’ nemi-
nem putamus a fructu satisfactionis et spe pacis arcendum. Cypriam, Ep. 55.
Besides ecclesiastical exclusion from the Eucharist, there was also the exclu-
sion ofexcommunicate persons “ from all entertainments of the faithful.’' Bing-
ham gives numerous examples of conciliar decisions to this effect (vol. vii, p. 98),
which explains the excommunicare et mensa vel pace of this extract.

³ Legilimo ordine paem'teant. One is almost led to understand this phrase of
the peculial· system of penance which prevailed in the Celtic Churches, by the
use of “ Penitentials‚⁷' as explained in the notes to Appendix Β. However, the
