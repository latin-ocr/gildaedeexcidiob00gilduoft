And the cause of its composition was to protect himself, with
his monks, against the deadly enemies that lay in ambush for
the clerics And this is a lorica offaz'tlz for the protection os body
and soul against demons and human beings and vices When
any person shall reeite it daily with pious meditation on God,
demons shall not dare to sace him 3 it shall be a saseguard to him
against all poison ancl envy; it shall be a guard to him against
sudden death; it shall be a Lorica for his soul after his decease. . .

’ And ‘ Deer's Cry’ is its name.” The account of the deer incident,
which is the foundation sor this explanation of the name Faed Fiada,
is found on p. 48; but another interpretation is also proposed, based
on the fact that the MSS. read not saed but sciath, and that ’“felll
fiada was a spell peculiar to druids and poets, who by pronouncing
certain verses made themselves invisible '’; the Irish title os this
noted Lorica, in this way, arose from the use of the Hymn “ as a
charm or incantation to secure invisibility.'' Here again, though
the hymn of prayer for protection is said lo be a cuirass or corslet,
a lorica (lnrech, cf. Welsh llurzg) yet the latter word is no name
for it ; nevertheless‚ at the time when the earlier Prefaces to Gildas'
Hymn printed below were written, it had become the ordinary
appellation sor it and for similar prayers, almost, it may be added,
with the constant implicatior] of a charin or incantation.

Other specimens of this kind of HymnS, called Loricae, are
given in the lrisll Liber Hymnorum, such as the Hymn Sen De of
St. Colman mac Ui Cluasaig‚ written, as is supposed, at the
beginning of the “ Yellow Plague,” which spread over Ireland
during the later years of the seventh century. Others also are
mentioned by Mone; some are unpublished; a translation of a
portion of one such, by Mr. E. J. Gwynn, is given on p. 210 of the
Liber l-lymnornm, which will certainly be helpfnl for comparison
with our Lorica :

“ God be with me against every sorrow, even the One noble Three,
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit l

The 'l'rinity be my protection against swarms of plagues,
Against su-lden death, against terror, against treacheries of lnarauders ἶ
May high Jesus keep me against the Red l'lague Σ

Against demons of all times, the Son of (Jod is my shield,

10 Against disease, against hints, against thunder, against tire.
20 Every chaste (lisciple who was tortnred for Christ,
Every meek, every gentle, every candid, every pure person,

Every consessor, every soldier, who happens to live under the sun,
