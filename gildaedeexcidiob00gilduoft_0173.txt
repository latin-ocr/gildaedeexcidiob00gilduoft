Armorica in the sixth century were bishops. Beda's account of Irish
monasteries of the north, Iona and Lindissarne, shows that there were bishops
who led a coenobite life unattached to any parochiae. lee Life ofDewi Sam‘
also mentions another bishop, Gwislianus‚ who lived with him as a simple monk,
and the consecration of deacons and presbyters within the monasteries is a
feature common to most of the Welsh Lives.

It seems evident that Gildas expected a higher sense of rectitude and
devotion from this third class than from the other two.

¹ Ab lzz's veniam imfierll'ri. Peculiar significance attaches to the “few''
whom Gildas excludes, or partially excludes, from his general invective. Resides
the present passage, a similar allusion will be found in cc. 26, 69, 92, too. It
is to the first of these——o 26—that he refers in the words ul iam in superioribus
dixz'3 and when the words used here, and in that section, are compared with
those of the other sections named, we find that Gildas recognises two classes
as standing outside the mass of those repudiated by him 1m

(1) In the first class are those who, so few in number (tam brevis numerus),
that the Church, their mother, does not know them as her own real sons, who
nevertheless lead a “noble life admired of all, beloved of God,⁷’ whose prayers
also had been the writer's firm support in the past. So far extends the
description conveyed in the section named. These we have already under-
stood to be the monks of his time. The present section adds, that the life of
these men is one which Gildas not only praises, but prefers to all the world⁷s
wealth ; in which, also, he earnestly hopes, some day, to have a share, if possible
(sz‘fierz'possit). But we have seen that he is already a monk. What, then, can
such a hope imply? An answer is furnished in the Epistle of Columbanus to
Pope Gregory the Great, written sometime about ΑΒ. 595. The Irish

missionary and founder of monasteries is disturbed by a new current of the
ascetic life : monks, he informs the Roman bishop, are seeking desert places in
the wilderness, impelled thereto by the fervour peculial· to monks (servare
vzonaslwrmn cogente), with the result that some find the desert a place for
higher perfection, while others give way to laxity of discipline. We learn from
the same letter that an Irish abbot, of the name of Finian, had consulted
Gildas respecting solnew a departure in monastic discipline, which involved
the abandonment of that common life, under a strict regula, that prevailed in
the cloisters. (This Finian was probably the founder of Clonard, not another,
who, owing to more trustworthy records, is better known, vi2., Finian of
Moville.) Gildas is said to have sent “ a most fit²¹ answer to his old pupil, then
at Clonard‚ presiding—if we are to believe what is said of him in prose and
verse—over a community of 3000 monks. Vemn'mms auctor Gz'ldam de his
interrogavit, et eleganfissime illi rescripsit. We are not told what the substance
of that answer was. The eager desire expressed by Gildas in the present
passage can, we conclude, be no other than a thirst for the cell of the recluso,
the meudwy (= servant of God ?) of the &Velsh. Some echo, perhaps, of this
appears in The Life os Oudocew, who was Bishop of Llandav about or after
the middle of the sixth century ; it describes Gildas as leading a hermit⁷s life in

the island ofEchni. “Ecce vir bonus et iustus et totius Brittaniae historiographus,
