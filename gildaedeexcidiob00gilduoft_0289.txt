Beginning of Gildas' preface respecting penance‚

(A.)

1. A presbyter or deacon committing natural or sodomite forni-
cation, if he have taken a monk's vow previously, shall do penance
for three years, shall pray for forgiveness every hour, shall do
superpositio every week with the exception of the fifty days
after Passio, shall have bread without measure and food fattened
slightly with butter on the Lord's day; but on other days, if he
be a wmkman, 3 measure of biscuit and broth slightly thickened,
cabbages, a few eggs and British cheese, a Roman half-pint of
milk because of weakness of flesh at that time; but a Roman
pint of whey or buttes-milk to quench his thirst, and the same
quantity of water. He is not to have his bed furriished with
much straw ; let him make some addition by three quadragesimae,
as far as his-strength will admit. Let him from his deepest
heart weep for his fault, let him above all things follow after

Spain, and Britain, the observance of a Saturday fast (ul omui sabbalo ieiunetur)
did not exist. The non—observance in Britain we know from this rule, which was
intended for penitents only. On the whole subject one might read, Dale‚ lee

4 Exceptis L diebus post passionem. The times of relaxation of penance are
given more fully in other later Penitentials, as in that of Cummean 3 they were
Sunday, Christmas Day, Epiphany, Easter, Ascension Day, Pentecost‚ the
feasts of St. John the Baptist, of St. Mary and the Twelve Apostles, together
with that of the local saint (W'asserschleben, Bussordn., p. 165 : Hi sunt dies,
qui non computantur in poenitentia, eto). These fifty days after the Passion,
beginning with Easter Sunday, were regarded as a time ofjoy for all.

⁵ Tres quadragesimas. Most, if not all, of the Penitentials use the Latin
quadragesima of auy forty days’ fast, not exclusively those of Lent. Du Cange
gives several instances of quadragesimae imposed by way of penance‚ the
earliest of which belongs to the year 821 : “singulas sex quadragesimas cum
sequentibus annis poeniteat⁷'; other instances impose twelve quadragesimae
“sine subditis annis’'. Morinus is quoted by him as suggesting that this kind
of quadragesimae, that is, in way of penance for sins committed, as distinguished
from those observed by all Christians, was introduced by Archbishop Theodore.
But we find the usage in the Celtic Penitentials of Britain and Ireland, as in
this one, at a period anterior to Theodore. The Latin Church observed three
