The Life os Gz'ldas. 363

the Lord and laid to a blessed rest. Her son also was distinguished

for his virtues and miracles, and completed with a blessed end the

saintly life he had led. Now the Bretons‚ in order to distinguish

him from the other St. Gssdas, do not call him Gildas, but
5 Trechrnorus.

26 And because through the miracles 01 Ηῐ5 saints, which are
recited in the ears 01 His believers‚ the Creator of all things, who
dwells in His saints and works wonders through thern, is praised
and adored, we have deemed it proper to write also 01 the power

10 which it seemed good to the Lord to work through His servant
Gildas in the district of St. Demetrius, For, in the aforesaid
district there was a pool, at the entrance of which robbers used
to loiter, who used to let off people who came thither, only when
they had been stripped naked ancl beaten, osten even half dead.

15 The inhabitants, therefore, of the surrouncling country were greatly
roused by their wickedness; and as they were unable 01 them-
selves to drive thern thence, they sought the protection 01 the saint.
He, on arriving at the mouth of the pool, entreated the Lord to
close up the entrance to that pool. When he had finished his

20 prayer, there arose from the sand a big rnound on the spot which
was the resort of the wicked men to lay their plots. On perceiving
this miracle, those who had come thither with the saint, glorified
God, and ever after held st. Gildas in deep veneration.

27 In the same district also there is an oratory which the

25 inhabitants call Mount Coetlann, which, being interpreted, means
the “ monastery of the grove.” As the men who were making them-
selves out to be possessors of that land often inflicted injuries upon
God’s servants who were there leading a life 01 contemplation, assert-
ing that they were tilling more 01 the land which lay around the

30 oratory of St. Gildas than he had marked out sor thern, the man of

 

we have an instance of the name, with the meaning· given by the biographer,
as Lan-coit (p. 32), which in Modern welsh is Llcmgocd3 and the many names
into which Lan· enters in Brstanny, lead us to expect the same order here also.
Against Dr. Zimrner, the name appears to me to belong to the same category
as, eg„ the words yd-lan, ίξωίη-ίίαη, not to mention others, where the impli-
cation is, an enclosed or special area, for corn (yd)‚ or for the vine (gasin). In
Welsh, a wooded enclosure or area is called coedlcm.

Bwrlymu mae’r ffynon‚ a llonydd yw'r llyn,
A minnau a grwydraf i goedlan y glyn.

The word in Britanny must be a very ancient survival, and of interest as to
the meaning of lan as a Celtic word.
