1 38 De Excidio Britanniae.

unenlightened by the correcter views which had begun to spread over the West
through the writings of Jerome. This fact is deserving of notice, because it
cannot fail to have some bearing upon the question of a late date for the
De Excidio. The Greek lists, from those of Melito of Sardes and Origen
(Eus., H. E, iv, 26, 143 vi, 25, 2), and the “Apostolic Canons,²' as a rule,
name only three books of Soloinon. The last-named, for instance, gives
Σαλομῶντος τρία· παροιμίαι, ἐκκλησιαστής, ᾆσμα ᾀσμάτων. So also does Athana-
sius, along with Gregory Nazianz‚ not to name any more. Consonant with
this view, Jerome, in his Preface to the Books of Solonion, writes: “though
broken down by a long illness, Ι have consecrated a three (lays’ labour to your
name, lest 1 should be entirely silent this year and mute towards you, that is, a
translation of the three books of Solonion.'' The next lines refer to ‘⁴ the book of
Jesus, the son ofSirach,’' and “ and another pseudepigraphic book called VVisdom
of Solomon.'' Even his bitter opponent, Rufinus, well read, however, in Greek
ecclesiastical writings‚ writes ε Salomonis tres ecclesiis traditi, and the Decretum
Gelasii, Salomonis libri iii. But the old list of Cassiodorus names Salomonis
lib. v, so also Mommsen's Cheltenharn Codex ; the Council of Hippo, aster the
Psalter of David, mentions Salomonis libri quinque, and Pope Innocent, in a
Rescript of ΑΙ). 405, likewise inserts in his list (brevis), Salomonis lz'brz'quz'nque;

 

the possibility of Jerome's guess that XVisdom was written by Philo, is inclined
to place it somewhere between 150 and 50 B.C., as the work of an unknown
Alexandrian Jew. English writers generally understand “the 38th year of
Euergetes,'' when the grandson of Jesus, son os Sirach, came to Egypt, as
B.C. 132. The Greek version of his grandfather⁷s book was made by him about

that time, so that the Hebrew original may have been written about 190-170 B.C.
This is the view of Schiirer also.

Quid praeterea beatus Esdras propheta ille bibliotheca legisl 60

¹ Ille bibliotheca legis. The explanation of this term as applied to Ezra
may be found in the book itself. 1f4 Esdras, or this particular part of it, be
placed as late as some critics conclude (c. A.D. 286), then the tradition can be
shown to have come into Christian communities long before it found expression
there. In any case, it must be regarded as part of Jewish tradition respecting
“ the men of the Great Synagogue.⁷'

l quote from the Revised Version of ¹xiv, 21 : “ For thy law is burnt, there-
fore no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, or of the works that shall
be done. But if I have found favour before thee, send the holy spirit into me,
and I shall write all that hath been done in the world since the beginning, even
the things that were written in thy law . . . . So Ι took the five men, as he
commanded me, and we went forth into the field, and remained there. And it
came to pass on the morrow that, lo, a voice called me, saying, Esdras, open
thy mouth, and drink that Ι give thee to drink. Then opened 1 my mouth, and,
behold, there was reached unto me a full cup, which was full as it were with
water, but the colour of it was like fire. And I took it and drank : and when
Iliad drunk of it my heart uttered understanding, and wisdom grew in my
bremt, for my spirit retained its memory : and my mouth was opened, and shut
