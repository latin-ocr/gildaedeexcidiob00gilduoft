teach them continually not to abandon the commandments that
are faithfully contained therein by falling off from the dignity of
priest. It will also become more evident to all that eternal punish-
ments await them, and the men who do not, according to their
5 powers, fulfil the teaching and commandments of those IessonS, are
not priests or ministers os God.
Let us therefore hear what Peter, the prince of the apostles, has
pointed out, respecting such a matter: Blessed be tlze God andra-teri, 3-5-
Fatlzer of our Lord Jesus Christ, wlzo by llis great mercy begat
10 us again unto lzope of life eternal by tlze resurrection of our Lord
jesus Christ from tlle dead, unto an inlzeritance incorruptible, that
fadetlz not away, undefiled, reserved in heaven for you, wlco are
guarded by tlie power os God. Why indeed is such an inheritance
foolishly defiled by you, which does not fall away like an earthly

“ nam nec Petrus quem primum Dominus elegit ...... vindicavit sibi aliquid

“ hoc erant utique et ceteri apostoli quod fuit Petrus, pari consortio praediti et

power‚'' De Un.‚ 4. But Optatus Milevitanus‚ who wrote in the stream of new
power under Siricius (c. 373), speaks of St. Peter as “head of all the apostle5,⁷⁷
(omnium apostolorum caput) (ii, 2), praeferri omnibus apostolis meruit et claves
