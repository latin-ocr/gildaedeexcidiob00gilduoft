Ι Ambulavit Enoch. The V ulgate reading is: „ambulavitque cum Deo, el
mm apparuit,- for the second clause Gildas writes, et non inveniebatur, which
answers to the LXX, καὶ οὐχ εὑρίσκετο. Cyprian twice quotes the same passage :

rendering osan older version.

ALLEGORY AND TYPE.

When Gildas adds, as explanation of the words “Enoch was not found,''
that he “was not found in the vanity of the world,'’ he, to our feeling, employs
a strange method of elucidation. But in this he is simply the heir of earlier and
greater thinkers, who led almost the whole Christian world into that kind of
exegesis which is called allegorical. Introduced first ofall into Christian literature
by Clement and Origen of Alexandria, at the end of the second century and
beginning of the third, this way of interpreting took firm possession of the minds
even of the greatest of subsequent writers. Except at Antioch, there was
scarcely a doubt of its supreme value. By this process, meanings were extracted
from a text of Scripture of which the writer had never dreamt, and to which the
literal meaning is frequently opposed. The method of allegory reposes upon
analogy pushed to extremes: something is discovered in a phrase, or even a
word, which recalls an idea of the mind: the idea may be of a speculative
character, moral or theological, but the text is transformed into an image of
that idea, and understood as containing it. By such a method history is
evaporated in typology. The literal sense does not seem to exist at all, as may
be seen from the interpretation put by Gildas upon the words ⁴⁶ was not found,⁷’
applied to Enoch. To him they mean that Enoch was not found in the vanity
ofthe world. Philo, the first to employ allegory, speaks of Paradise with the
implication that such a place never existed in reality; the description of Para-
dise, for him, is a description of wisdom, and the four rivers mean the four
cardinal virtues. Clement borrowed principles and methods from Philo, and to
some extent they are with us to this day. It is impossible not to smile at some
of the allegories found here : the three hundred (318 in reality) servants of
Abraham typify the mystery of the Trinity 3 the only daughter whom Jephtha
sacrificed means our sels-will. Most of these are stock examples which may be
traced back to Origen or Clement, or their master Philo. “Les allegories de
