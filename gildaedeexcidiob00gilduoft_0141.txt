THE QUOTATIONS FROM THE Boon or Jon.

'We have already referred, in the Note on Gildas's quotations‚ to the fact
that the earliest text of the Greek version of Job was considerably shorter than
that which is found now in any MSS. The Latin version, in its oldest forni,
followed this shorter abbreviated Greek text, and, before Origen, could follow no
other. As in the case of the shorter LXX, all MSS. of this ancient shorter Latin
version seem to have been completely lost : we have, however, the asterisks
affixed by Origen to the verses which he supplied from Theodotion⁷s version,
preserved in Greek, Latin, and Syriac MSS. The hypotheses that have been
advanced to account for this strange fact, deserve close and earnest attention
from a student of the history of the text of Scripture ; but any attempt to state
or judge such hypotheses, would be quite out of place here.

Jerome, in the Pracsszlio in Librnnzsob (Vulgate), states that previous to the
translation or edition which he had lately published wille asterisks, from seven
to eight hundred lines of the book were wanting to the Latins. This edition,
as has been previously observed, is the revision which he made, about 392, of
the Old Latin translation, upon the basis of the LXX Greek, before the greater
work of translating from the Hebrew had been taken in hand ε though it seems
to have quickly superseded the earlier in Italy and other parts, nevertheless,
Britain, about 540, still used the older imperfect version. The public reading
of such a truncated book, he sayS, was an ugly thing, which his revision
had attempted to remove. (Ceterum apud Latinos, ante eam translationem
(editionem) quam sub asteriscis et obelis nuper edidimus, septingenti ferme aut
octingenti versus desunt; ut decurtatus et laceratus corrosusque liber foedita-
tem sui publice legentibus praebeat.) The portions of Job preserved for us in
this work of Gildas, represent that mutilated form, as Jerome regarded it, of the
book, and one unworthy to be read in the public service of the church. Ι place
