1 34 De Excidio Britanniae.

edition of the Vulgate, the Clementine of 1592, prints the Prayer of Manasses
along· with 3 and 4 Esdras at the end of the New Testament as extra seriem
Canania-orum Librorum} Gildas, therefore, agrees with the usage of early
Latin writers, and the Tridentine Council, by his inclusion of XVisdom and
Ecclesiasticus as parts of scripture, but differs from them by including also
in the same this evidently pseudo-epigraphic book, 4 Esdras. On the other
hand, all the Reformed Churches, as well as the Lutheran, have clung to
the Hebrew Canon as stated by Jerome, so that XVisdom, Ecclesiasticus,
3 and 4 Esdras, though allowed to be read, are regarded as non-canonical.
We have, on this account, to place the British Church, as represented by
Gildas, outside this view also of the Canon: it agrees with neither the
Reformed nor the Tridentino doctrine of canonicity.

2. XVhen we look somewhat more closely at the history of this book, which,
as understood by Gildas, carried a truly prophetie message unto men, we find that
some strikingly interesting facts have come to light respecting it. To add a
brief account of these would be equivalent to placing ourselves at a better point
of vantage for understanding the significance of such quotations as this chapter
contains, in a message addressed to our ancestors.

The order of books found here is somewhat strange; after Malachi come
Job, Esa'ras, Ecehel, lVisdom, Ecclesiasticus. It might appear as though the
two books last—named were actually placed at or near the end of the Old
Testament in the codices used by Gildas. But the way in which Wisdom is
introduced by him leads me to conclude that this was not the case. Upon
placing Ezekiel aside, he says : “enough of threats uttered by holy prophets;
I have thought it right to add a few words from the book of Wisdom to this
little wo-rk of mine, words which set forth encouragement and intimation no
less than threats ;'' he will, he says, not be os those who are unwilling to move
a finger by way of help to carry the burdens imposed by them, and, therefore,
will quote words of consolation. We may safely conclude that the order of
the whole series of minatory quotations ends with Ezekiel, because, with a
changed purpose, the writer would naturally go back to former books. There
remain, thus, as his last books, Illalczchi‚J0b, Esdras, Ezekiel. Perhaps no
one can quite explain how this unusual order came to prevail in Britain; but
other illustrative lists are not wanting. It is difficult not to name here, first of
all, the finest Latin MS. of the Bible : this is the well-known Codex Amiatinus,
preserved in the Mediceo-Laurentian Library at Florence‚ but proved to have
been written in Britain, at the monastery of Wearmoudr, sometime about
A.D. 700!

¹ The contemptuous words of Jerome to Vigilantius respecting this very
4 Esdras, from which Gildas quotes, are piquant, whatever else they may be.
One is tempted to quote them. “Tu uigilans dormis, et dormiens scribis: et
proponis mihi librum apocryphum, qui sub nomine Esdrae a te, et similibus
tuis legitur: ubi scriptum est, quod post mortem nullus pro aliis audeat
deprecari: quem ego librum nunquam legi. Quid enim necesse est in manus
sumere, quod ecclesia non recipit ?'' Contra Vlgr„ 7. Migne‚ Toni. i.
