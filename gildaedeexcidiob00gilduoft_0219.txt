iniquities. The leaders thereos judge for rewards and the priests
thereos gave answer for hire, and the prophets thereos were divining
for money, yet did they rest in the Lord, saying .· Is not the Lord in
the midst of us ,· evils shall not come upon us. T heresore shall Zion

5 for your sahe be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be lihe the
walch-tower of an orchard, and the mountain of the house as a place
of forest. After a while: Woe is me because J have become as one Micalz vii, 1-3.
that gathereth stubble iu harvest, and as a bunch of grapes in the
vintage, when there is not a cluster to eat of its first sruits ,· woe is

10 my soul Ι it perisheth in works of earth, always doth reverence for ἢ

the poor, and let none remember malice against his brother in his
