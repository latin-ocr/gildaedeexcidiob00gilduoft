lee Lorz'ca of Gildas. 307

Ι5 May thrones, powers, archangels,
principalitieS‚ dominions, angels,
defend me with their thick array,
and be strong to overthrow my enemies.
Then also the other arbiters of the strife—
patriarchs four, prophets four,
Apostles, watchmen of the ship of Christ,
And the athlete martyrs all—I ask,
And adjure also all virgins,
faithful widows, and confessors,
²5 that safety compass me by them,
and every evil perish from me.
May Christ make with me a strong covenant,
He whose terror scares away the foul throngs.

⁶[The end of the First Prologue‚ of grades of angels and patriarchs‚ apostles
30 and martyrs with Christ.

Beginning of the Second Prologue, respecting all parts of the body down to
the knees.]

God the unconquerable guardian,
defend me on every side by thy power.
Free-Thou all limbs of mine,

words which seem almost to baffle every effort at explanation. Their meaning
was known not only at the time when the Old-Welsh glosses were written in
the Luxemburg Fragment, but also at the time of adding the Irish glosses in the

Leablzar Breac. This may, in fact, be an argument for assigning an earlier date
to the matter of that MS. in respect of the Lorz'ca than the date of the MS. itself.
Drs. Wright and Todd made several suggestions to Dr. Stokes in the direction
of assuming a Semitic origin ; this can in no way be unnatural ; the enumera—
tion os parts to be protected begins here, and a mystic quality would be given to
the Lorica by the employment of Oriental words at the commencement. And
yet the words are scattered here and there over the Hz'sperz'ca Famz'na and
Luxemburg Fragment as well-known terms of the Vulgar Latin of the sixth
and seventh centuries. We must not sorget that the uncouth spelling may hide
lost or forgotten Latin and Celtic nouns and verbs, such as gamba in v. 68,
of which we have other examples. It appears possible to classify the words
referred to under the following heads :—

(a) Words of plainly Semitic origin 2 (1)gibre(= gibrae or gybme) v. 34,
and the adjective gibriosus (Luxemb. Frag.>, for which the glosses give lcomo,
ltumamcs; the original may be the Hebrew geber or gz'ber meaning man.

(2) senae or semme = leeth, v. 39, and the adjective semzosus (Hz'sp. Fam.) from
the Hebrew sitin or sen, meaning tootlz. (3) Jdumae, v. 41, from the Hebrew

yedaim .· the word is found here as a double plural, suggesting unpointed
