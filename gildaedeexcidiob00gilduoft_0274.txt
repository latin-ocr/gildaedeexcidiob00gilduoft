IV. GiLnAs AIT DE MONACHIS.1-Qui veniunt de 10c0'2 viliore
ad perfectiorem, quorum abbas ita degeneravit ab opere Dei ut
mereatur ad mensam sanctorum non recipi, sed et fornicationis
crimine, non suspectionis, sed mali evidentiS, onerari,—suscipite
sine ullo scrupulo monachos tales ad vos de flamma inferni con-
fugientes, nequaquam eorum consulto abbate. Illos vero, quorum
abbatem de mensa sanctorum propter infamiam non arcemus, non
debemus illo nolente suscipere. Quanto magis3 venientes a sanctis
abbatibus et nullo alio modo suspectis, nisi quod habent pecora et
vehicula vel pro consuetudine patriae vel sua infirmitate, quae
minus laedunt habentes, si cum humilitate et patientia quam
aratra trahentes et suffossoria figentes terrae cum praesumptione
et superbia.

ITEM—Navi fracta, qui potest natare, natet.

Quicquid4 autem monacho de rebus saecularibus superabundat,
ad luxurias et divitias debet referri, et quod necessitate, non
voluntate habere compellitur, ut non penuria cadat, non illi
ad malum reputabitur. Capitibus namque praecipua corporis
ornamenta delata non debent inferiora despicere et manuum
cotidiana commoda superbire superioribus fas non est. Nonne

'³ Loco viliore. The word locus by itself stands not rarely for “ monastery‚''
as in Columbanus’ letter, primae conversionis loca reliquunt, where also
conversio means the assumption of the monastic life. The Welsh compound,
mynach-log‘, shows the same word (monachi locus).

We gather fi om this passage that the monastic communities in Britain had
no regular order of intercommunion with one another, every monastery being
independent os every other ; whereby, in cases of degeneracy on the part of an
abbot, the monks were encouraged to abandon him by the ready reception
offered in another monastery. This might be a locus pezfhclior, and the
desertion was carried out without any communication with the abbot, when
the un—cleanness of his life was evident to all. The Hibernensis, xxix,
12, directs that a monk is bound to leave a wicked abbot (debet monachus
abbatem valde malum deserere). But if the abbot of an ‘⁴ inferior⁷’ monastery
were in church communion, monks that left him were not to be received
except with his assent, even though they were in search of a more perfect
discipline. As between monasteries, there evidently existed no higher authority
to command uniform rules of life : it was that early time of their history when
the character of individual cloisters was determined and known by the
character of the abbot himself, who was generally the founder. A new and
extensive development of monasticism was taking place, the result of that
revived religious life which, first in XVales and afterwards in Ireland, was
inspired by Gildas and by the friends who urged him to write the De Excidio 3
in Ireland it began with Finnian, a disciple of Gildas, at Clonfert; never-
