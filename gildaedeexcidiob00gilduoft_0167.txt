seas, able to grasp this much-coveted prize. We seem to have in this passage
a reminiscence of c. 25, which informs us that those parts beyond seas, in
worthier aid, had secured an asylum for many from the sword of the Saxons (alii
transmarinas regiones petebant cum ululato magno). The passage to which
reference is now made, no less than that in c. 25, presupposes a long and well—
established community‚ where churches might be strong and individual bishops
influential. Such a place these ambitious men would find in Armorica, where
countrymen of theirs had been settled since no very recent date. One is slightly
puzzled at first, in reading some of the Vitae, such as, for instance, that of Paul
Aurelian, at coming across not only the name Britannia, but such old names of
districts or kingdoms as Dcmmom'a and Cormcbia, in Britanny. These names
were carried over, just as “Plymouth” and “Bost011,’' and more recently
“Cambria‚'' were carried to America. It has been well argued of late that
the settlement in Armorica was older than the Saxon invasion of Britain,
and continued long after the time referred to by Gildas in c. 25. lt consisted
chiefly of tribes not affected by the ravages of the Saxons until after the
time at which Gildas wrote this work, and was probably pacific in characters*
But what concerns us chiefly is the fact that British ecclesiastical life, thus
transferred quietly to a new soil, stood in bold contrast with the more
developed life of the native Gallic church ; the same in essentials‚ yet different
because of an older type. In Gaul, the bishops were few in number and the
organization of Metropolitans had taken strong hold of the country, so that
British usages, in the neighbourhood of these Gallic Metropolitans, seem to
have appeared teeming with abuses and irregularities. We find Licinius,
who was Metropolitan of Tours from 509 to 521, addressing a letter to two
presbyters of Brittany, deprecating their transgression of canonical regulations,
but particularly in reference to the very usage condemned by Gildas, in
c. 66, as to unseemly intercourse of priests, under specious disguises‚ with
women.† The Council of Tours, in 567, thought fit specially to determine:
“that bishops should not be ordained in Britain (z'.e., Britanny) without the
consent of the metropolitan and his co—provincials⁷' (Cone. Tarm„ c. 9).
Such a decision implies that ordinations of an irregular character—irregular
according to the more advanced usage of Gaul—had been going on for a
long time; this explains c. 673 and there can be no doubt that, judged
by canonical usage, the three ordinations, described in the Life of Paul of
Leon in Armoric Damnonia‚ must have fallen under like censure. The last,
however, presupposes the newer, later, and specially Celtic organization, as
were also the foundations of Tudwal at Treguier, Brioc at Champ du Rouvre‚
Malo (Maelovius) at Aleth, and Samson at Dol. The British lived a life apart,
tenacious of ways that had become antiquated in the country to which they
had migrated, as well as of others created by themselves,
