Feast of St. John the Baptist. The second was called grawys ganas in the
welsh Church. The Greek Church observed four “ forty days.⁷'

¹ Semper ex intimo corde defleat culpam suam. The moral character and
motive of the time, and of the discipline of penance‚ is revealed in these words: it
ismade still more prominent in the Penitentials os Finnian and Columbanus.
The latter begins with the following words, which have a peculiar force in their
very simplicity: “True penitence is not to yield to things that one must be
penitent for, but if we have yielded, to weep sor them. Yet, because the weak-
ness of many, one may almost say of all, disturbs this penitence, we must
recognise measures of penance (poenitentiae). And ofthese the following order
is sanctioned by our holy fathers, in such a way that the length of penances
should be in accordance with the magnitude of sins (culparum).²'

As its time advanced, the severity of the penance was modified by a milder
treatment, as the next words imp1y3 post annum et dl'meclz'tmz, the penitent‚

though still remaining a penitent‚ is to partake of the Eucharist and return to
church communion, ad pacem veniat.

² lnfi’rioregradu. The first rule refers, as was said, to monks who are
presbyters or deacons 3 the present one to two other classes. The first os these
is a monk who is not, strictly speaking, a cleric, but belongs to the so-called
minor orders (ordines minores). In a monastery the most common lower
grade, especially for young boys, was that of Reader (leesor); there were
besides the exorcist, acolyte, ostiarius (vide Hinschius, Kz'rchenreclzt, iv, 492).
The second class is a layman engaged in manual labour, operarius.

³ The third rule gives evidence of the estimation in which the monastic life
was held, because a monk, though a layman as to ecclesiastical consideration,
is equivalent in spiritual rank to a presbyter or deacon.

⁴ Valncm'l. Here, probably, stress is laid on the intention when sin is not
actually committed. Quaerens el non invenerit is the wording of a correspond-
