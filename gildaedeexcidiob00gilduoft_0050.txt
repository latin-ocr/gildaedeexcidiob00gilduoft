ADDITIONAL NOTE To cc. 5-7, 13-18.

Gildas in these chapters refers to Roman interference as exercised on four
different occasions. Unless we condemn the whole narrative as confused and
undeserving of credit, it may be well to endeavour to find some points in which
the account given of Roman visits touches well ascertained facts of history.
Such an enquiry will, 1 believe, yield some results not devoid ofinterest.

1. Remembering that the leading purpose of this work was to bring about a
reformation of morals in Church and State, that it is in fact a Sermon, or a
“ Tract for the Times,⁷' we must recognise that the writer is in no way bound to
present his facts in due order of occurrence. Even more may be said: heis
not bound to narrate events which, because of their high importance in fashioning
subsequent events, have a special claim upon a historian. He is free, and in a
way would be wise, to choose those that have a special bearing upon the message
he brings to the notice of his readers. This is exactly what Gildas seems to me
to have done : in no way does he call this part “a history ;'' his intention is
simply to say “a few things⁷' respecting the points named by him, before
sulfilling his solemn promise (ante promisum Deo volente pauca . . . . dicere
conamur).

The first visit or expedition of the Romans to Britain is placed by him
“ aster the first peace with the Parthians.⁷' The empire of the world had
been won, and an almost universal peace had come to pass (c. 5). Gildas may
have read tlte Third Book of Orosius' Historiae, where we find similar mention
of a Parthian peace (post Parthicam pacem), followed by a general cessation of
war, and obedience to Roman laxv. This was in Rc. 20 under Augustus, after
the advance of Tiberius Nero into Armenia. (A full account is given in Merivale's
li’ome zmder Ille Emperors, vol. iv, p. 173.) Orosius relates these events in order
to show that the light of Christianity came into the world at the same time
(quodsi etiam, cum imperante Caesare ista prouenerint, in ipso imperio Caesaris
inluxisse ortum in hoc mundo Domini nostri Jcsu Christi liquidissima probatione
manifestum cst—lissa, iii, 5, 8). Gildas also introduces the rise of Clnistianity,
but aster relating the events of two Roman expeditioris to Britain.

Now, by many writers, both these have been understood as the expeditions
os Julius Caesar (stc. 53, 54). The Presace, sor instance, to the Alon. Hist.
l1'm‘lanm'ca, speaking of the narrative of Gildas, says : “ It may be divided into
two pcriods ; the former extends from the first invasion of Britain by the
Romans to thr: revolt of Maximus at the close of the fourth century, and the
latter from the revolt of Maximus to the author’s own time.'' 1 find it very
(lifficult to accept this view. In any way some confusion in the mind of Gildas
