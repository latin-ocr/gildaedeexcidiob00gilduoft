The Ruin of Britain. 127

twenty cubits in length. It is the curse which goeth forth over the
face of the whole earth ,· since eveiy thies shall from it be punished
unto death, and I shall cast him forth saith the Lord Alnu'ghty ‚· and
it shall enter into the thief's house, and into the house of swearing
sfalsely in 7ny name.
58 Holy Malachy the prophet also says: Behold the day os the Mal. iv, 1.
Lord shall come, burning as a furnace,· and all the proud and all
who work wickedness shall be as stubble, and the coming day shall set
them on fire, saith the Lord of hosts, which shall not leave of them
10 root or shoot.
59 But hear what holy Job also has taught respecting the be-
ginning and end of the wicked, saying: Wherefore do the wickedlob xxi, 7-13-
live? And they have become old dishonourably, and their seed is accord-
ing to their desire, and their sons before their sace ‚· and their houses are
Isfi‘uitful, and never is the sear or the scourge os the Lord upon them.
Their cow hath not been abortive, and their animal, [ngr with yoimg,
hath brought forth and hath not gone astray,· but it abideth as an
eternal flock, and their children rejoice, taking up both psalteiy and
hart). They finished their life in good things, and stept into the
20 rest of the grave. God, then, does not regard the deeds of the
wicked? No, not so, I conclude. But the candle os the wickedsab xxi, 17-20·
shall be extinguished, and calamita! shall come upon them, and pain as
osone in childbirth shall hold them through anger. And they shall
be like chaff before wind, and as dust, which the wlu'rluincl carrieth
25 away. Μ ay his goods fail to his children. Let his eyes see his own
destruction, and may he not be redeemed by the Lord. After a while,
of the same: T hose who have carried away the flock with the Job xxiv, 2-7·
Shepherd, he sayS, and have taken away the beast of the orphans, and

he does also several of the harsh constructions already referred to. The Greek
iS καὶ εἷς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ ὀμνύοντος τῷ ὀνοματί μου ἐπὶ ψεύδει, but the Latin here
employs a verbal noun instead of the participle: mendacium may be an
adverbial accusative, with the active idea implied in z'uratio-——mendaciter3
Vulg. iurantis in nomine meo mendaciter 3 or it may be an instance of an accusa-
tive after a verbal noun used as a verb.

³ lisalachias: as in Gildas, this book is twelfth, following Haggai and
Zechariah‚ and last, in all arrangements of the minor prophets. We may com-
pare the short quotation made here, with the large space given to him by
Gildas in addressing the clergy‚ because Malachi's prophecies are directed,
chiefly, against abuses and corruptions prevailing among the priests.

4 Dominus exercituum. The Greek is κύριος παντοκράτωρ, but the Com-
mentary of Jer0me‚ as well as the Vulgate‚ imply another reading, κύριος τῶν
δυναμέων, which the critical notes of Holmes and Parsons give as that of the -
Complutensian LXX, but without any mention of MS. authority.
