were built in suitable places, Men of noble rank, together with
their wives and children and families, were baptized. Now, when
St. Gildas saw that the fruitful offspring of Christianity and the
holy religion was everywhere increasing‚ he was filled with unspeak-
5 able joy, and said thus unto the Lord : Ithaule Theo, Lord jesus
Christ, who iu Thy morey hast thought fit, by the grace of Thy holy
name, to eulzghteu this people that have too long been strayiug,
aud hast made it attath uuto knowledge of Thee‚· aud that upon
us who, up till this moment, uuhappy aud uuseehbzg, have been
10 wandering in the land os the shadow os death, the⁷ lzght os Thy
rzg‘hteousness hus shoue at last, (md eterual peace now rezgrns
within us.
IO Now, St. Bridget, an illustrious virgin, who dwelt and flourished
at that time in the island of Hibernia, and presided as abbess over
Ῑ5 a nunnery‚ on hearing of the renown of St. Gildas, sent a messenger
to him, saying with entreating words: Rejoz‘ce‚ holy father, (md

the messenger whom she had sent. She joyfully took it, and
gladly received it as a heavenly gift sent to her from him.

From the Annczls of Tigernach we have substantially the same information,
though the dates in Tzssgernach are uncertain 2 the other dates are, Chrou.
Scotorum, 5693 Annals ofluissalleu, 561 ; Four Masters, 566. Further infor-
mation respecting Ainmire may be gathered from Vita S. Columbae, i, 7, ancl
iii, 5, in Dr. Reeve's notes.

It is easily seen that eo tempore, referred to the three years' reign of Ainmire,
can in no way include the time when St. Eridget was Abbess of Kildare, neither
could the Irish visit of Gildas cover the more than forty years which intervened
between the two. Nevertheless, this reference to Ainmire seems to contain a
really historical event3 &Velsh intercourse with Ireland began during the late
sixties of the sixth century. “ Unless all the traditions given in Lives of Saints
are fictions, there can be no doubt that, during the sixth century, the Irish
Church was in a way built anew. So great a multitude of monasteries are said
to have been founded then, that there appears to have been no corner of Ireland
without its monastery. Among the founders of these, some arrived at such a
height of excellence that they had with thern immense crowds of monks. Such
were Finian, Abbot of Clonard, in Meath, whose disciple Columba himself is
