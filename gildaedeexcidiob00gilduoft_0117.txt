T lze Rain af Britain. 105

Lord lzatlz spoken evil against thee. For even now, it is certain,

there are some teachers filled with an opposing spirit, declaring

for depraved lust rather than for truth‚ whose words are made pffllmlffiffl·

sostei· than oil and yet are very javelins‚ who say, “ peace, peacess'levzmvi. 14 *-
sarid there shall not be peace sor those who persist in sins, as UH’H'

the prophet elsewhere says : ‘¹ [llere is no joy for flze wicleed, sae'llz lsasalz xlviii,

41 Azarias‚ also the son of Obed, spoke unto Asa, when he was

returning from the slaughter of ten hundred thousand of the
10 Ethiopian army, saying : Tlcc Lora' is willa you, wlzz’lst ye are willa Π Chr011.xv‚2‚

H im ‚· aad ifyc seek H im, Hc will be famca' Ofyou ,· ana' z'fye leave

Him, He will leaveycm. For if Jehoshaphat, while aiding an unjust

king, is thus reproved by the prophet Jehu, son of Annanias,

saying : If tlzoa helpest a sifmer ον lowest lzz'm whom llze Lorcl hatelh, ΙΙ chron. xix,
15 {lle anger os Goa' οη ίΙῑαί account is upon thee, what shall be unto ²'

them who are bound in the fetters of their own crimes? The sins

of these men, if we wish to fight in the Lord's battle, we rnust hate,

not their souls, as the Psalmist says : ΥΕ wlco love llce Lora, scale Psalm xcvi,

evil. ω’
20 What did the afore-named Elijah, the chariot of Israel and

horseman thereos, utter unto the son of Jehoshaphat‚ even Jehoram

the murderer, who butchered his noble brothers, that he, a bastard,

might reign in their stead. Tlms saz'llc tlte Lora Goa' of tlcsfaz‘ller 11 Clmm. xxi,

And hear ye also how Zecharias‚ the son osJehoiadah‚ the prophet,

menaced Joash, King of Israel, when he abandoned the Lord, as ye

the present verse is quoted. It is also quoted below, c. 109, but the words
show a remarkable variation, unless we regard the present passage as an adap-
tation. We may place them side by side and apart from their context.

C. 109. C. 41-
Criniculis peccatorum suorum unus- Propriis scelerum suorum criniculis
quisque constringitur. (unusquisque) compeditur.

LXX. σειραῖς δέ τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ἁμαρτιῶν ἕκαστος σφίγγεται. Vulg.‚ et funibus
peccatorum suorum nmmo) constringitur.
