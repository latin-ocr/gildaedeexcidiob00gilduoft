VITA II.

“VITA GILDAEJ' WRITTEN ΒΥ CARADoc OF LLANCARVAN
(OR NANCARVAN).

THIS “ Life ” was first published for the English Historical Society
by the Rev. Joseph Stevenson, to accompany his edition of Gildas
for that Society (1838). Stevenson printed the Vita with meagre
help from a MS. which belongs to Corpus Christi College‚ Cam-
bridge—139, 24, vell. folio (twelfth century) (Petrie, Descm'ptz've
Catalogue, 436)—but he made use, as basis, of another MS„ of
which the original home was Finehale, near Durham—MS Burney
310 (fourteenth century)—-together with the second transcript
mentioned below. Another MS. at the British Museum of the
same work as is found in the C C C MS„ is described by Mr. Petrie
(440), “ MS. Eccl. Dmlelm„ Bk. 11, 35, 7, folio. A fine copy, written
about the year 1166.” It is upon the Burney MS. from Durham (B),
together with the fine Cambridge Codex (C), that the Vita, as printed
here, is based by Mommsen (ils. G. H„ Chronica Asinam, vol. iii,
fasc. 1). The Eritish Museum possesses also two transcripts of the
Burmjv MS„ which are described by Petrie under 438, 439, as
“MS. Slmme, 4785, ff. 9-15‚ and MS. Reg. 13, Bk. VII, ff. 20-
25b.'' An epitome made by John of Tynemouth, about the
middle of the fourteenth century, is printed in Capgrave, Nova
Legenda Angliae, ff. Ι 56- 560, and by Colgan in Acta Ss. Hiberniae,
177-78. A very usesul account of some of these documents will
be found in MSS. Relaling to W'ales in tlze Britz'slz Museum, by
Mr. Edward Owen, pp. 101, 111.

An attempt is made in the Introduction to weigh the amount
of credibility which may be attached to this Life as compared
with the preceding. We only note now that it is probably from
three to four centuries later than the earlier part of our Vita J,
and that the whole perspective of events narrated is different.
