51 Holy Habakkuk also crieth out, saying: Wcoe to him that bnildeth Habak. ii, 12,
a city in blood, ancl prebareth a city by iniqnities‚ saying .· Are these 13'
things not from the Lora' Almigrhty 2? and many peoples have perishea'
by fire, and nations many have been diminishea'. He thus begins his
prophecy with a complaint: How long shall I cay, ana' thon wilt Habalc- i. 2-4-

10 not hear? l shall cry nnto T hee, why hast thon given nnto me haral-

kings, judges, priests and prophets. Gildas finds apt utterance in the words of
