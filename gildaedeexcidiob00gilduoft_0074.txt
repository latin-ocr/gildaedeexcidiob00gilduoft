favour the hypothesis '² (vol. ii, p. 189). His hypothesis was accepted by Free-
man and Green. But it is one extremely difficult to fall in with, and must, one
seels, be put aside for the older view. There was no need of a very elevated
site to build a fortress, while the neighbourhood of Bath would supply hills for
such a purpose. Moreover, the very similarity of sound in Bad-bury and
Ball-on-icus is itself something to rouse suspicion rather than to suggest Dr.
Guest⁷s inference. The name Alons Badonis is found in Nennius's Historia
Britomzm as the place where the “twelfth battle '' was fought under Arthur.
The Annales cambriae place Bellum Badonis opposite a doubtful date (ΑΛ).
516) ; a fragment published in the Brut of Llyfr Coch o Hergest speaks of the
“battle of Badwn ⁷' <gremia Badwn) p. 404, while other parts of the Brut
mention Kaer razdom, and once there is mention of esgob Bad. In all these
places there can be no doubt that the meaning is Rath, as in “capitulum LXVIII ’²
of the Historia Britomcm (p. 130 Mommsen's edn.) ; De stagno calido, iaz qm)
balnea sunt Basienis (baths of Badon) secundum uniuscuiusque voti desiderium.

¹ Quique quadragesimus quartus ..... There has been much contro-
versy as to the meaning of these words. Beda took them to mean, sorty-
four years after the coming of the Saxons to Britain z quadragesimo circiter et
quarto αηηο adventus eorum in Britanniam. M. de la Borderie, in an article
in li'ewte Celtiqzte‚ vi, 1—13‚ holds that Beda’s rendering is the true one, and
in this way arrives at the conclusion that the date assigned to the siege of
Badon Hill by the Annales Cambriae is incorrect. Certainly A.D. 516 cannot
be the date of that battle for several reasons ; the entry in the Annales Cam-
briae has all the appearance of an erroneous boi-sowing from Nennius, c. 56,
of matter not found in the Irish translation, and extremely legendary in
character. Dismissing the date 516, M. de la Borderie arrives at 493 as the
date of the battle, which, he holds, Beda deduced from GHdas, rightly under-
standing· his words to convey the meaning of sorty-four years after the settle-
nient of the Saxons. But the French scholar inserts the words adventus eorum
in Britanniam before ut novi. In the note on Ambrosius Aurelian we have had
an instance of the way in which Beda niixes literal quotations from Gildas with
his own words, interpreting the latter⁷s meaning in better words or phrases.
As no MS. authority exists for this insertion os M. de la Borderie’s, it seems
