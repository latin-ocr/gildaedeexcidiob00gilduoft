again, we are driven to conclude that our biographer is wrong as to the time of
the fact he records.

The solitary sojourn upon an island is an extremely probable incident of
Gildas’ lise; we see that he sighs for a retirement of this kind in the middle
of his warfare. The Book of lem'dv represents him as leading such a
life on the Island of Echni (in insula Eclmz' ducens ancleorz'talem vitam), of
which island the position is clearly indicated by words found on another page :
‘² alom,r the Wye till it falls into the Severn ; along the Severn Sea by the island
of Echni as far as the estuary of the Towy²⁷ (Book oleandciv, Evans' edition,
pp. 135, 139, 368). The Vita S. Cadoci, c. 29, also mentions this hermitage:
‘⁶ Cum beatus Gildas in insula Echni⁷' (c. 29); see also Vita ll, c. 9. The
anchorite lise on the island mentioned in this passage may well have been a
continuation of that which was begun on the island in the Eristol Channel. ln
c. 28 it is called Horam, and by Breton writers is identified with the island
llouat.

¹ ln monle Reuvz'siz‘. Here Gildas built the monastery called after his
name Salas Gildas de Ruys ; at first it must have been a place where the severe
Celtic discipline, afterwards made famous on the continent by St. Columbanus
and his disciples‚ was practised 3 in time, however, the community yielded to the
general progress which transformed so many cloisters into Benedictine houses.

Perhaps I cannot do better than translate the description given by the
Dominican, Albert la Grand, in his l 'ies des Saints de la Bretagne A rmorique,
which 1 take sroin the new issue (1901) of the third edition of 1680. “The
benedictino Abbey of St. Gildas is situated in the 500 of Vannes, on the
peninsula of Rhuys‚ which might be called a terrestrial paradise, 01· Land of
