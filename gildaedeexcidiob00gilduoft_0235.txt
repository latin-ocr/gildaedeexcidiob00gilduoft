97 But let us see what a true disciple of Christ, Paul the teacher of
the gentiles, utters in such a matter when he says in his first

teacher as he himself exhorts: Be ye zmztators of me as l also am Ι Cor. xi, 1.

it nevertheless, as it will apply fully to the priest together
with the people (Christians) of this age. After a few words we
read: Wlm etclianged tlte t7ntli os Godfor a lie, and w07 sllipped and Romami 25.

2 Prima epistola. “ First epistle '³ must mean first of the series of epistles,
as was becoming common through the influence of the Vulgate—the order, sor
instance, in the Codex Amiatinus—GospeIS, Acts, Romans. Had Gildas the old
order in mind, prima epistola would have meant, first of the Pauline epistles.
The order in the list given by Cassiodorus, secundnm antiquam translationem,
places the Catholic epistles between Acts and Romans3 so also Isidore of
Seville‚ and, of course, the leading Greek codices except N. An incidental
mention of this kind, just as the position assigned to Isaiah and Jereiniah
(though not to Ezekiel), in the Old Testainent, shows how the Hieronymian
Bible was gradually making its way into general use in Britain.
