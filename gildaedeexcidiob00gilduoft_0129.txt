The Rnin of Britain. 1 17

49 But God forbid that what follows should befall you : Thon shalt ser. vii. 27, 28.
speah all these words nnto them, and they shall not hear thee ,· and
thon shalt call them, and they will not answer thee ‚· ancl thon shalt
say nnto them .· This is a nation which hath not heard the voice os the
5 Lord its God, nor received correction ,· faithficlness is perishea', and is
taken away from their mouth. After a while: Will he who falls Jer. viii, 4-7·
not rise again, and he who is turned away not return ,Ρ chy then
is this people in Jerusalem turned away with obstinate bachsliding ,Ρ
They have seizea' falsehood, and have refnsea' to return. l watchea'
10 ana' hearhened, no one speaheth that which is good. Τ here is none who
repenteth of his sin, saying .· What have I a⁷one ? All have turned
to their own course, as a horse i'nshing headlong into battle. The leite
in the heaven hnoweth hei‘ time, the tm‘tle and swallow ana' stoi‘le
have kept the time of their coming ‚· My people lenoweth not the jndg-
15 mentos God. And the prophet—terrified at so great a blindness of
the irreligious and the unspeakable drunkenness, weeping also for
those who do not weep for themselves (just as miserable tyrants
bellave now)—desires that an increase of tears be given him by
the Lord, speaking as follows: For the grief of the daughter of my Jer. viii, 21;ix,
20 people am I worn ont,· astonishment hath tahen hold of me. Is 3-
there no balni in Gilead, or is there no physician there ? thy, then,
is the wonncl of the daughter of my people not closed? tho will
give water nnto my head, ana' nnto mine eyes a fonntain os tears P
And J shall weep day and night for the slain of my people. Who
25 will <give me in the wilderness a lodging-place of wayfaring men 5?
And l shall leave my people and go away from them, since they are
all adnlterers, an assembly of treacherons men. They have stretchea'
their tongae lilee a bow of falsehooa' and not of tenth. They have
become strong in the land, because they have proceeded from evil to
30 evil, aad have not known Me, saith the Lord. Again z And the Lord Jer. ix, 13-15-
said: Because they have forsahen M y law, which I gave nnto them,
and have not heai‘hened anto Μ y voice nor walhed therein, ancl have
gone after the wichedness os their heart ,· on that account, thus saith
the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, behold I shall seed this people
35 with wormwood ancl give them water of gall to drinh. And a little
after, speaking in the person of God, a way which the prophet very
frequently assumes: There-fore pray thon not for this people, Cl7ldser.xi,14.
raise not npfor them praise and prayer, because I will not hear them
in the time of their clying nnto M e and their trouble.
50 What then shall unhappy leaders do now? Those few who

 

but relents‚ so that the humbled one shall not perish‚ even those few elect ones
could not bring divine punishment upon them.
