seemed good to the Lord to proclaim the merits of this man even
in his lifetime: for far ancl wide were his praise and commenda-
tion resounding in the mouths of the sailors of that part of the
country. For it seemed good to the Lord to work so many powers
5 and miracles through him that hardly anyone could relate or count
them. He died on the 27th of November, in the house of the
monks of St. Peter of Maille', in the fort of Bellum-videre,
whither he had-repaired owing to the advantages of its monastery.
But when it had been announced by the public crier that the

hastened thither, and humbly begged that the body of his monk
should be restored to him. But they returned him no answer;

sums of money which flowed in daily from every direction to his

complaining of the wrong of stealing his monk's body. The
bishop, because the monks had refused to obey his injunctions,
35 ordered them and their abbot to repair to his synod ; he ordered
the Abbot Vitalis also to attend. When, therefore, they had come,
and both sides had pleaded their case in the synod, the bishop
