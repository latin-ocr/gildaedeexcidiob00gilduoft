The two sayings of Basil, and probably the bulk of what is narrated, Gildas
owes to Rufinus, xi, 9, where he continues the History of Eusebius ; but there
are some details found here which indicate a wider knowledge than could be
procured from Rufinus. The account of the persecution of Basil at the hands
of Valens is found in Theodoret, iv, 193 Socrates, iv, 263 Sozomen, vi, 16;
as well as in the work of Rufinus. The facts are more fully given by Theodoret
than by the others, and he appears to have had Gregory of Nazianz’ Oratio in
laudem Basilii [Magni as an independent source; the Orationes of Gregory
were also translated into Latin by Rufinus, as he himself states in the very
chapter from which Gildas quotes. Is it not possible that Gildas was acquainted
with the incidents of the persecution from either Theodoret or Gregory, as well
as from Rufinus? There is no mention in Rufinus of what is implied in the
words Arriano caeno; whereas, Theodoret expressly says that the emperor
had commanded the Praefect Modestus either to persuade Basil to com—
municate with Eudoxius (the Arian bishop of Constantinople), 01· in case he
refused, to exile him.

into communion with the Arian Eudoxians.
