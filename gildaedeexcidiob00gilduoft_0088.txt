sint perpeti immortales igni animae quam sanctorum laetitiae.

Quid tu enim, insularis (iram, multorum tyrannorum depulsor 33
tam regno quam etiam vita supra dictorum, novissime stilo, prime
in malo, maior multis potentia simulque malitia, largior in dando, 5
profusior in peccato, robuste armis, sed animae fortior excidiis,
Maglocune,1 in tam vetusto scelerum atramento, veluti madidus

peccaminum regiae cervici sponte, ut ita dicam, ineluctabiles,
celsorum ceu montium, innectis moles? Quid te non ei regum 10
omnium Regi, qui te cunctis paene Brittanniae ducibus tam regno
fecit quam status liniamento editiorem, exhibes ceteris moribus
meliorem, sed versa vice deteriorem? Quorum indubitatam

1 Magloczme. Maglocunus is the Mailcun of the previous note, great-
grandson of Cunedda Wledig. The name appears as Maelgwn in modern
VVelsh, generally Maelgwn Gwynedd, designating him as king· of that portion
of North XVales which was called Venedotia, and later Gwenedotia. The
ancient Gwynedd extended from the river Clwyd (according to some, from the
river Conway) westward, and to the south as far as the Mawddach or Dyfi.
Maelgwn had as teacher the celebrated Illtud, and may or may not have been
at his monastery at the same time as Gildas himself. The vow to take upon
himself the secluded discipline of a monk came after having a taste of the
stormy life of a king ι the monastery, however, was abandoned, and Maelgwn
seems—partly through his own brilliant qualities‚ partly as a family right—to
hare attained a position of pre-eminence over the other princes, or, as Gildas
puts it, “te cunctis paene Britanniae (lucibus tam regno fecit (Deus) quam
status liniamento editiorem ...... ⁷² On the legend, which gives at least
an echo of this fact, see [Velslz Laws (1841), ii, 49-51. According to the
Ammles Cambriae, he died of the great plague in the year 547: “ An.
[547] mortalitas magna in qua pausat Mailcun rex Guenedotiae.⁷' The
date, 547, can only be an approximatepne. Petrie, in the first edition,
which appeared in the llsmmm. Hz‘st. Brit„ supplied 444 as the year of
the Christian reckoning· corresponding to ANNUS I of the Annalist, though,
as 'ne confesses, there is no certainty with respect to the era adopted by
him (De aera vero, unde in annalibus condendis exorsus sit chronographus,
mininie constat). Some well-known dates of events are a few years wrong;
others, especially the later ones, correct, as given in the Annales. Dr. Stokes
does not add the corresponding years for the Irish Annals of Tigernach, which
