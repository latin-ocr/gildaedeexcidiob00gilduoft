leine become a fool, tleat lee may be wise. For tlee wisdone os tleis
world is foolisleness witle God. And after a while : Yonr glorying 1 Cor. v, 6, 7,
10 is not good. K now ye not tleat a little leaven leavenetle tlee wlmle

example, and by flattery. In later passages he speaks thus of evil
teachers ε For snclefalse apostles are deceitfeel worleers, transforming 11 Cor. xi,
tleeneselves into apostles of Clerist. And no nearvel ,· for Satan leim- 13'15·

102 Listen also to what he says to the EphesianS. Are you
ignorant that you are held guilty of something in this particular?
35 T leis l say and testify in tlee Lord, tleat ye no longer walk as tlee Eph. iv, 17-19.
