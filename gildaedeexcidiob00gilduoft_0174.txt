Sacerdotes2 habet Britannia, sed insipientes; quam plurimos 66
ministros, sed impudentes; clericos, sed raptores subdolos;
pastores, ut dicuntur, sed occisioni animarum lupos paratos, quippe 10
non commoda plebi providentes, sed proprii plenitudinem ventris
quaerentes; ecclesiae domus3 habentes, sed turpis lucri gratia eas
adeuntes; populos docentes, sed praebendo pessima exempla,
vitia malosque mores: raro sacrificantes4 et numquam puro corde

 

Gildas sapiens, ut in historiis nominatur, qui eo tempore convertabatur in
insula Echni ducens anchoritalem vitam.'' (Vita b. Oudocei, in Evans' lee
Book osLlrzna'av, p. 138.) The Welsh addition on p. 135 places Echni in the
estuary of the Severn z “ Hafren nyhyt can ynys Echni.''

This trace of what we may regard as real history is interesting ; Gildas the
monk, at present in the beat of his battle against ecclesiastical declension,
when bishops decline the task, looks longingly for the seclusion of a cell, such
as a number of his acquaintances had already found, in the desert. Is our
explanation of his language be correct, it disposes completely of the view
adopted by many, that Gildas wrote this work, late in life, at the monastery of
Ruys in Brittany. Such, it is well known, is the account given in The Life of
Gillias written by the monk of Ruys, but the passage we have been noticing
proves it to have been impossible.

(2) The second class of “the few '² appears in cc. 69, 92, 109. It consists of
bishops and presbyters against whom no charge of schism, 01· pride, or
uncleanness can be brought. In his treatment of these worthy men, the real
Gildas reveals himself more fully, perhaps, than elsewhere. He is not at all
unwilling to consess their good qualities (quod nec vehementer-et 7705d1'ffile'mur):
he knows that they are “ chaste and good,'' that many of them have obtained
the “ apostolic throne³³ in the recognised way (legitime), being well able also
10 confer spiritual gifts (c. 92), but—they are 1101 heroic, they should be made of
sterner stuff3 some are too like Eli ; martyrs are not found among them ; they
have not fearlessly excluded the wicked from the Church. Who of them like
Abraham, he asks, is willing to offer a son, if need be, in the cause of Christ?
who, as Joseph, has rooted out of his heart the remembrance of an injury?
(Eildas' soul is grieved and troubled within him that the good “ few '⁷ are not
awake to the awful call of the time: they also must be numbered among the
invrfex sacerdoles* of C. 83.
