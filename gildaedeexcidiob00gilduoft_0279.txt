Fragmenls from Lost Letters. 207

That judgment about the uncertain issue of life has come to Matt- xryi.
pass when we read in scripture of an apostle lost by covetousness‚ ΛΜΨ '⁰⁰¹¹'

and a thies, by confession, carried to heaven.

VII. ITEM.--It is better for co-bishops and co-abbotS, as well
sas fellow-subjects‚ not to judge. As to men of evil odour in
anything bad, let men, however, in no way make fully clear that
they think of them by report, but gently rebuke them with
patience. These men, as far as they can conscientiously do it,
they ought to avoid as men suspected (but without excommuni-
10 cating them as really guilty and excluding them from their table, or
from church communion) when some cause, arising from necessity,
or agreement, or public speaking, demands it. Let them reprove
those men that they do not act rightly, because we cannot pass
condemnation upon them for this. While they communicateICor- xi, 29;
15 unworthily, it may be that we, by our evil thoughtS, are com- x, 20'
municating with demonS. But those whom we know without
any doubt to be fornicators, unless they do penance in the regular
way, we exclude from communion and table, to whatever order they
have belonged by rule. As that saying is, If any man is namedI Cor. v, 11-
20 a brotlzer and is a fornicator, etc. It is on account of well-proved
cases of great sins, for no other reason, that we ought to exclude
brethren from the communion of the altar and of our table, when

the time demands it.

 

place assigned to the first words of the extract in the Hibernensis, as well as the
inclusion of bishops in the directions given, would lead us to understand the
words as referring to ordinary ecclesiastical discipline. The expression, or
similar ones, could not be rare in this sense: Canon 28 ofthe Council ofOrange

(AD. 441) has per poenitentiam legitimam.

4 Si quis frater nominatur et est fornicator; this reading stands for ᾗ in
the Greek, not ἤ, just as the Vulgate: Si is qui frater nominatur sorm'calor
(sit), but is nearer the early Latin version of irenaeus: Si quis srczler nomi-

natur fornicator (iv, 27, 4).

⁵ Principalimlc vitiorum. The fourth of the Inslrttcliones of Columbanus
treats of “The eight leading vices '' (De octo vitiis principalibus). Octo sunt
vitia principalia, quae mergunt hominem in interitum ; gula, fornicatio,
cupiditas, ira, tristitia, accedia (ἀκηδῖα, in old English accidie), vana gloria,
superbia3 that is, gluttony, fornicafion, covetousness, anger, dejection, bitter-
ness, vain glory, pride. The list is first met with in Cassian's Instituta, bk. v, 1,
and Collczl„ V, 2, which formed the basis for all similar lists current in the Celtic
Churches. We have the same also in the Regula of Columbanus, c, 8.

⁶ Communicalionc altaris et mensae j communicatio (=fellowship) seems to
be a survival of an old word that had, elsewhere, gone out of use in this connec-
