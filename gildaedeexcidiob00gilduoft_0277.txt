V. GILDAS SAYS: An abbot of the stricter rule should not
admit a monk of another abbot sornewhat more lax. Also, the
more lax should not detain his monk when inclined to stricter

Priests and bishops have in truth an awful judge, to whom, not

to us, it appertains to judge of them in both worlds.

the Church previous to the rise of monasticism. A presbyter owed obedience to
his bishop; a bishop had a high and definite authority in the Church as to
worship, and discipline—perhaps all the higher, where, as in Gaul, the metro-
politan system was but imperfectly developed, or in Britain, where it had never
existed. How, then, were these older powers and relations to be kept intact,
face to face with the absolute authority of an abbot? In Gaul the position of the
bishop became secure in general acceptance, as superior to the abbot and his
monastery with certain fixed limitations‚ but in Britain and Ireland the position
of the abbot seems to have acquired an increasingly more independent charac-
ten* The obedience due to him is regarded by Gildas here as parallel to that of

the clergy to their bishop.

 

ᾗ For Gaul in the fifth and sixth centuries we may refer to the canons of the
third Council of Arles, A.D. 4553 Thomassinus, Vetus et Nova Disciplina, Ι,
Lib. iii, c. 26. Hefele, Conciliengescli„ ii, 583. The sense osan earlier time is, in
a very interesting way, as usual, shown by Jerorne in his Ep. 14, 8, ad Heliod„
eg„ Sed alia, ut ante perstrinxi, monachorum est causa, alia clericorum.
Monachus si ceciderit, rogabit pro eo sacerdos ; pro sacerdotis lapsu quis
rogaturus esset? also Ep. 52, ad Napotz'anusn.
