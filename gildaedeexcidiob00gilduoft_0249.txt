seniorem) ; trained in the ways os discipline which Paul set forth to Titus and
Timothy; 5ο that, meditating day and night in thy law, Almighty One, he may
believe what he reads, teach what he believes, follow what he teaches. May he show
righteousness, constancy, mercy, strength in himself; may he convince by example,
strengthen by admonition ; so that he may preserve thy gift pure and spodess, and
through the observance of thy people transforni the body and blood of Thy Son by a
pure consecration (immaculata benedictione), and, with unchanging love may attain
unto the perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of fulness, the fulness of Christ
in the day of justice of the eternal judgment, with pure conscience, with full saith,

filled with the Holy Spirit.
Then came the unction of hands, and the prayer given above.

(c) When a bishop was to be ordained, an examination was made as to his
character and saith, and the unanimity of his election by the suffrages of the
presbyters and clergy of the church over which he was to preside, as well
as the people of the city and the surrounding¹ district (leslz'monio presby-
terorum et lolius cleri et consilio civium ac consistentium). If satisfied, the
audience exclaim: nglzus est. Then follows a long invitation to common
prayer; and after it the benedictio, which M. Duchesne believes to be Roman,
not Gallie: “J'inclinerais donc,'' he says, “a croire que la formule est toute
romaine et qu⁷il ne subsiste pas de. formule gallicane pour cette partie de la
ceremonie.'⁷ May we not suppose that the old Roman custom prevailed in
Gaul, until there was found a more excellent formulary in this later Roman
prayer? That old Roman custom has, probably, been preserved in the
so-called “Canons of Hippolytus,'' which contain the earliest-known form of
prayer used at the ordination of a bishop. Dr. Hans Achelis has published
these canons in parallel columns with the “Egyptian Church Order'' and the
corresponding passages of Book V111 of the Apostolic Constitution.* They
represent, according to his view, the usage of the Roman Church, about
A.D. 200, in the ordination and appointment of bishops‚ presbyters‚ deacons,
lectors‚ subdeacons, widows and virgins. Now we find that the same form is
here used for the ordination of bishop and presbyter, which would be the norm
for the earliest usages of other Churches in the VVest; so that, although the
prayer itself might take new forms, this idea, that sor presbyter there should be

the same prayer as for bishop, held on with great tenacity.
[Ι am tempted to put this ancient type of the ordination rite into English,

that the reader may himself see what must have been the basis of many later
forms, among them, the British, in the time of Gildas.

Can. ΙΙ. The bishop shall be chosen by all the people¹ Let him be temperate,
as is written of him in the epistles. During the week in which he is ordained let the

people say ; ¹¹ We have elected hinist*
Amid silence on the part of the whole people, after the confession, let all
pray for him, saying :
O God, strengthen him whom Thou hast prepared for us.
Then let one from among the bishops and presbyters be elected to lay hands
upon his head, and pray‚ saying :
O God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ; the Father of mercies and God of all
consolation, Who dwelleth on high and hath respect to the humble, Who knoweth
