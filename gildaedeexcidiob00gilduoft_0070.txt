58 De Excidio Britanniae.

acervatim iugulabantur: alii fame confecti accedentes manus

had returned to their own settlement. The first occurred under the leadership
of Ambrosius Aurelianus ; the second came by the siege of Badon Hill ; both
exceeded all expectation or hope on the part of the Eritish. At the time when
Gildas wrote, there were many alive who had been eye-witnesses of the two
events, who could not, he remarks, resrain from frequent mentioning of them.
He himself was born in the very year of the later victory, forty-three years and
one month from his time of writing ; but the success to which the generalship
of Ambrosius Aurelianus led was acquired at no considerable time before that,
as it must fall within the memory of one life. If we take the year of Gildas'
birth as c. A.D. 500, then the battle of Badon Hill took place c. 456-7, and
the successes of Ambrosius Aurelius may be put not far from A.D. 450.

¹ T ransnmrinas petebant regiones. Gildas in these words certainly implies
that there was an emigration osa considerable part of the Britons os this island
to the continent. He has already intimated the same in c. 4, where he tells us
that his information is derived not from native sources but from continental
ones. What ngrlzt have existed of the former had, he says, either been burnt
by the enemy, or carried sar away by that fleet which conveyed his countrymen
into exile. This was the beginning of Britanny‚ or Armorica, but the emigration
continued far on into the seventh century. Another vieW, maintained by many,
may be stated in the words of Dr. Freeman: “Here the ante-Roman population
still kept its Celtic language, and it was further strengthened by colonies from
Britain, from which the land took its later name of the Lesser Britain, or
Britany” (Hist. Geogr. os Europe, p. 93). French writers, especially French
Celtic scholarS, hold a very different opinion. M. Loth, for instance, in his
exhaustive Hislmy of tlze Brz‘lislz Emigrczlion in Armorica, thus sums up the
conclusions of M. de Courson : “ In every place where the insular Britons are

not established, the names of places are Gallo-Roman ; men’s names are Latin
or German. The territory of Rennes and that of Nantes . . . . are of this kind.

The old Vannetais, even, towards the end of the fifth century, presents the same
character. The tyrant of Vannes, in the Life of St. Melam‘us, is named Eusebius,
his daughterAspczsia, and the “ villa '⁷ in which he resides Prima Villa. Every-
where, on the contrary, where the Britons are established, the names of men and
of places present a Celtic character. Men's names are the same as in VVales
and Cornwall ; the names of places are generally preceded by a British prefix‚
as in the island; tres (hamlet), ploi, plau, plen, plo (plebs = Welsh plays,
meaning at first a congrqgralion, then llze district inhabited by the congregation
