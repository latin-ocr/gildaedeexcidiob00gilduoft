counsellors, and particularly by Judicae'l, the bishop of Vannes,
who specially loved him, he at first built small dwelling—houses in
the afore-said districts. But in those parts there were churches
without roofs and partly pulled down3 and between the walls
5themselves old trees had grown, while some had blocked up the
very doors At that time there was in that part no dwelling-house,
no intercourse between man and man, but even the churches
themselves were the haunts of wild beasts. Now, to undertake a
work of such magnitude seemed to everybody a laborious and
10 difficult task. ssut he, trusting in the Lord, did not hesitate to
attack it, and was not frustrated in his hope. For within a few
days the best men and the clerics flocked to his aid ; and by their
help, he restored the churches‚ built houses, and planted vineyards
and orchards : even the children were brought up by them in the
Ι5 service of God.

37 Throughout that time also the Bretons broke out in rebellion
and stirred up wars. For the peasants rose and flocked together
against their lords. But the nobles, when Count Alain had
joined them, attacked the bands of peasants, killed, scattered, and

20 pursued them; for they had entered the battle without a leader
and without deliberation. Afterwards some of the nobles rebelled
against the Count; but they did not succeed, for he was not a
cowardly and inexperienced man. Since, during these tumults,
he could not live in quiet and peace, Felix determined to return to

25 his own monastery3 for it was now sixteen years since he had
been sent over to this place by his abbot. But the Duchess
Havoise anticipated his attempt. For she sent, by a certain man
named Filim, who was travelling with him, a letter to his abbot,
beseeching him not to detain him on any account, but to give him

30 an abbot’s blessing and send him back again to her ; for her sons,
Alain and Eudo, were now grown up, and ready to perform
everything which their father had promised him.

38 When, therefore, the Abbot Goslin had read the letter, he
called the monk Felix to him, and asked him wherefore he had

35 come, and why he had left those places, and the congregation he
had committed to his charge. Because, said he, l cannot serve
God tlzere in peace and quiet. The abbot said to him : Dost thou,
tlzen, expect to leave in tlzy country wlzat Christ did not find 2'721J071nii,6.
His ? T herefore, if tlzolc wz'slzest to attain lo Christ, thou oughtest

40 tlzysels also to walk even as He walked. For it is ‘through many Acts xiv, 22.
tribulatz'ons‚' as tlte apostle says, tlzat ‘ we must enter into tlte K ing-
dom of Godff T lzerefore, my beloved son, bear vexationi* patz'ently
