136 De Excidio Britanniae.

of the Benedictine Abbey of S. Germain des Pres at Paris, but is now located
in the Bibliotheque Nationale (date ΑΛ). 822). All MSS. known until lately
show a strange lamma in ch. vii, between verses 35 and 36. Here a leaf had
been cut out, because, as M. Bcrger puts it, it contained a passage which
appeared to discountenance prayer for the dead, and all Bibles have, for six
centuries, depended upon this one mutilated Codex. The “Missing Fragment”
was discovered by Prof. Bensly, of Cambridge, in a MS. of Arniens, the Codex
Anzbztnszx(.»x), and published by him in 1875 at the Cambridge University
Press. Ch. vii now contains, therefore, 139 verses instead of the old 70. He
shows plainly how near [lte text es Gz'ldczs z's lo tlzat found in tlte A miens Codex,
as compared with certain Spanish codices, which also contain the missing part.
That MS„ of Cent. IX, may suggest to us what Gildas also read in ln‘s copy ;
its contents are :—-

Ι Esdras=our Ezra and Nehemiah..

II Esdras = ΙΙΙ Esdras of the Vulgate‚ or I Esdras of the English
Apocrypha.
III Esdras= IV Esdras, i, ii. ΞΙΙ Esdras, i, ii of Auth. Version.
IV Esdras= IV Esdras, iii-xiv ΞΙΙ Esdras, iii-xix·

V Esdras=IV Esdras, xv,xvi=11 Esdras, xV, xvi „

Dr. M. R. James, in Text aad Sludz'es, vol. iii, 2, has given a full account of
the interesting questions connected with this book, but it would be out of place
to introduce here from his pages the valuable material which he has placed at
the disposal of students os the book and of Apocalyptic literature. He shows,
confirming Dillmann⁷s view, how scanty is the authority for the fusion into one
book of portions that are proved by early quotations and copious MS. authority
to have been separate. He says, that about the cominonest arrangement in
MSS. of the books assigned to Ezra is the following :—<

1 Esdras=Ezra, Nehemiah.

II Esdras=IV Esdras, i, ii.
III Esdras=III Esdras.

IV Esdras= IV Esdras, iii-xiv.

V Esdras= IV Esdras, xv, xvi (=Gildas’ Esdras here ?).

Some modern editors, Fritzche for instance, have designated chapters xv,
xvi, as “The Fisth Book of Esdras.’' Now Gildas quotes only from these
Chapters, which inclines us to the belief that in his “ Bible'' they formed a single
book. The fact that he calls Esdras “prophet'' may perhaps favour the view
that his Book of Esdras consisted of those chapters‚ andi, ii, since ch. i begins
with the words : Liber Ezme prophetae. Yet the appellation ‘⁶ prophet,'⁷ though
found nowhere in the Bible, is applied to Ezra as early as the time of Clement
of Alexandria. The peculiar character of Chapters i, ii, xv and xvi, has led
smne of the best commentators to regard then] as Christian interpolations, of
which the soriner was written, according to Gutschmid, about A.D. 201, or 160
according to Yolckmar, the latter (the chapters from which Gildas quotes),
during the period of inartyrdom, A.D. 260-268. These Chapters are marked
by a stern tone of denunciation, after the manner of the older prophets, and as
surh wore xxa-ll adapted for (jildas' special purpose.
