T he Lorz'ca of Gildas. 301

I quote these verses because it is strongly maintained by Dr.
Zimmer that a writer, while priding himself on good Latin
(Ausonicus in the Luxemburg Fragment is glossed italicus), could
not make derogatory references to Irish Latin, or Irish butter;
on the other hand they led the first editor, and have led, since,
several others to conclude that the Hisperz'ca Famina must be the
production of some Irish monk. The latter view certainly appears
the more probable; the man seems to be playfully poking fun at

himself as an Irishman‚ and at his country's products The next
line should be added ε

“ Carniferas prensis dentibus ruminavimus fiemzasf'

“ We pressed our teeth and chewed the fleshy joints.”

And two more :

“ seu spumaticum bombosi lz'lhz's flustrum
inertes oppressit naufragio remiges ?’'

“ Or hath the foamy flood of the raging sea
overwhelmed the weary rowers in shipwreck ?''

I now add a list of single words which are peculiar to the three
documents named, and partly to (our so-called) Gildas’ Lorz‘ccz, or
his De Excidio.

Famen (plsamina), in the sense of word, though I believe not
found in Gildas, occurs several times in the Irish Hymns, and is
employed by Ieuan‚ the son of Sulyen the Wise: “post tantum
populorum famine famam ’' (H. and 5., i, 666). We find it also in
Saxon circles, as in the Epp. Bonisacz'z' et Sullz', pp. 245, 429, etc.

Tz’thz's, as a term for the sea, is seen in the above extract.
But besides these documents, the note on p. 44 of the De Excidio
will show that it, as well as the adjective tz'tlziczts, ranges over Irish,
Welsh‚ and Armorican writings. But far more peculiar are the
following, of which we know the meaning only from the glosses.

conae eyes idzmzae hands
tarsum breast pallzam sorehead
clf²dum neCk palare to reveal
ἕζζῗςω man senae, or sennae, teeth
gibriosus} humanus sennosus with teeth
gzgrra head; gl. cepa, Cle-op„ tales members
gygra fol. 4 5b.

Taking the documents together, we are struck by the frequency
with which these strange words occur. A Hebrew or Semitic
original has been sought for most of them, though, on closer enquiry,
one is tempted to abandon this as suspicions. There may have
been reasons, nevertheless‚ for the employment of words that
