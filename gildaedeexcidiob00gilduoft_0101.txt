much more grievous are the sins of this time, than those of the

A mere glance at Hartell⁷s edition will make this plain. Basil wrote his
Ἠθικά, and Cyril of Alexandria his Βίβλος τῶν θησαυρῶν after the same manner.
The same may be said of a work not unlike Gildas’, the De Regibus Apossalicl's
by Lucifer of Cagliari, addressed to the Emperor Constantius ; not to mention
the speculum, long supposed to be the work of Augustine. Gildas, thus,
has many and great names as fellows in this mode of wriffing, and those who
are students of the Textual Criticism of Scriptural Books know of the peculiar
interest attaching to such continuous extracts as are found in the works named,
as well as in this of Gildas.

1. The present is, perhaps, the most appropriate place for attempting a
somewhat more continuous study‚ than would be possible in separate notes,
of the quotations that begin with the next chapter. A brief summary of the
history of the Latin versions of the Bible will not be out of place for some
readers, as introductory to the detached points of interest which meet us in a
survey of Gildas’ quotations. It was during the unrest of Maximus' five years'
reign (383-388), that Jerome prepared his first partial revision of the Latin
Bible. This comprised the Gospels and Psahns, and in that year, 383, the
Bishop of Rome introduced the revised text into the Service-book at St.
Peter⁷s Church. For this reason the Psalter has been called the Roman
Psalter. The Praefatio ad Damasum of this work may be read in every
edition of the Latin Bible. But by 392, Jerome had prepared a new revision
of the Psalms, again in accordance with the Greek version of the ‘⁶ Seventy,''
from which the older Latin version had been made at first; but of this the
only parts that have been preserved are the Book of Job and the Psalter,
which found a special reception in Gaul, and was consequently styled the
Gallie Psaller. It is the text now found in all editions of the Vulgate Latin.
This is, therefore, over fifteen hundred years old, a notable instance of the
firm conservatism inherent in the Christian Church, because the remainder
of the Bible, as read in Latin, is a new and more perfect work of Jerome.
In it we have a new translation, attempted for the first time, from the
original Hebrew of the Old Testament, together with a revision of the
New Testament from the Greek. This great work was carried on and
finished during the years 390-4o5‚ when Jerome was living the life of a
monk at Bethlehem. The book of Psalms in this new version is called
the Hebrew Psaller. We find that the use of it in the Cliurch was literary
rather than liturgic. It may be read in Tischendorf's edition of the Vulgate‚
the text being that of the celebrated Codex Amiatinus, written, as is now
well known, in Britain3 but there is a special interest in the fact that
Ricemarcus, the Bishop of St. David’s who wrote the Life of Dewi Sant, used
this Hebrew Psalter. His own copy—a most beautiful MS. written by his
