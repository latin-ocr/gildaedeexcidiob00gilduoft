to have known nothing about the early life of Gildas. There is no
mention of his teacher, Illtud, nor of any of his contemporaries
except Cadoc, the reputed founder of the monastery where the
imaginative biographer lived. The account given, so bare and
pointless, of visits to Gaul and Rome, can have no meaning to us,
when we have known how frequently such constituents enter into
the making of Lz'ves ofSaz'nts, but particularly from our reading of
the De Excidio. It is further impossible to accept the story,
introduced from Menevian sources, respecting the failure to preach,
when St. David’s mother was present in the church ; because, from
many reliable sourceS, we know that these two men had a
common time of childhood under one abbot and teacher. We
recognise a germ of truth in what is said of Gildas' activity in
lreland, studium regens et praedicans in civitate Ardmczca ,· so also
in the account of the anchorite life on the island of Echni, and the
preservation of a codex of the Gospels at Llangarfan, believed to
have been written by the saint’s own hand. But all the sections
1044, in reference to Glastonbury and Gildas’ tarrying there, can
be no otherwise regarded than as a piece of literary fiction, his life
in Britanny being entirely ignored, in order to magnify King
Arthur and Glastonbury. The poor attempt made by Caradoc, in
the last section, at an etymological explanation (Holder calls it
volks-ez‘ymologie) has led many of us astray3 but it is of a piece
with the whole matter of the Vita in relation to this place (see
note on Vnisgutrin, c. 14).

Stevenson, in the Preface, is inclined to doubt the authorship
of this Vita by Caradoc, partly on documentary grounds, partly
because of the writer's conception of Arthur. He regards it as
impossible that a contemporary of Geoffrey of Monmouth could
speak of Arthur as rex rebellis, or as undergoing penance, dolens el
lacrimans, for his past misdeeds. But it may be observed that a
representation of Arthur quite in accordance with this may be
found in the Vita David, and that, though such a picture is not
found after Geoffrey, it is quite possible in a contemporary. We
have, however, what appears to be strong documentary evidence
in the thirteenth-century Cambridge MS. that Caradoc was the
author. Stevenson seems to have made but very partial use
of this MS„ and in his notes refers to the verses at its end as
found “in Ussher’s Ms.” The archbishop mentions a ccdex that
was in his possession, adding that it contained the rude distich
printed below, from the CCCC MS„ clearly attributing the
authorship to Caradog of Llangarvan. ‘⁸ Albanii [Gildae] vitam
