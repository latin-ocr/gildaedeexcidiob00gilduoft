94 De Excidio Britanniae.

The Vulgate reads: Nunc autem dicit Dominus: absit lzoc a me .· sed qm·-
cunque glorzficaverlt meglorzfirabo eum .· qui aulem contemnunt me, erunt zjgrno-
biles. &Vhen we look at the LXX, we are tempted to regard the significant
omission that is found in Gildas' text,as representing the ancient imperfect anti-
Origenian LXX. As found in Codex Β 11 15 καὶ νῦν φησὶν Κύριος Μηδαμῶς
ἐμοί, ὅτι ἀλλ’ ἤ τοὺς δοξάζοντιὶς με δοξάσω, καὶ ὁ ἐξουθενῶν με ἅτιμωθὴσεται.
Gildas was, apparently, acquainted with three forms of the First book of
Samuel.

5. Without entering into details, it may be said that Gildas had copies of the
Vulgate for the following books of the Old Testament3 The Pentateuch,
land II Samuel, Ι and ΙΙ Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah‚ Lamentations, and pro-
bably Malachi. as well as old Latin copies of several of these books, if not of
all. The Old Latin codices used by him contained the following: parts of
I Samuel and I Kings, ΙΙ Chronicles, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes‚
Ezekiel and nine of the Minor Prophets, Wisdom of Solonion, Ecclesiasticus,
and IV Esdras (II Esdras in the Apocrypha of the Authorised Version).
Counting allusions to the contents of Biblical books, as well as quotations
from them, we find all the Old Testament books referred to by Gildas except
Ruth, Esther, Daniel, Obadiah and Jonah. I have felt disinclined to mention
any works besides this of Gildas, but, at this point, it may be well to observe
that Fastidius, who wrote in Britain probably c. 420-430, shows no trace of
Jerome’s version in his Old Testament quotations; the books of Isaiah and
Jeremiah, for example, have the same Old Latin character as the minor Prophets
in Gildas. Fastid, De vila Christiana, Migne, Tom. 50.

The New Testament appears to be on the whole in the Vulgate version, with
the exception of I Peter, 11 Timothy in Fragment A 111, and, probably, certain
parts of Acts, though, as 1135 been said, with many readings different from the
common text. Taking allusions as well as quotations into account, we find that
Gildas omits mention of the following: 11 Thessalonians‚ Philemon, II Peter,
the epistles ofJohn and Jude. See Index I.

II.

1. The fact that the text of the Latin Bible contained in Gildas' De
Excidio was in many places different from that of the Vulgate, did not escape
the observation ofthe learned Italian, Polydore Vergil, who brought out the
first edition of the work in 1525, under the patronage of Dr. Tunstall, bishop
of London. But Polydore Vergil, as he partly avows in his preface, changed
the Old Latin quotations in conformity with the Vulgate. Five or six editions,
printed on the continent, between 1534 and 1569, at Basel and Paris, repro-
duced this of l'olydore Vergil, as was also done in the edition of J. Daye,
London, 1563, though apparently, aster consulting some MS. or other. ssut when
Josselin, the secretary of Archbishop Parker, brought out in 1568 the second
edition, the extracts were duly printed in 1110 form for which his MSS. fur-
nished evidence. After accusing his predecessor of making unjustifiable
changes and additions in the text os Gildas, he proceeds: “The Holy testi-
monies of Scripture, which he (Polydore Vergil)retains‚ are not all placed in
the very words found by him. Instead of these he substitutes certain parts
out of 11131 version, which we commonly, but erroneously, call the old. This,
in the time of Gildas, had not been accepted for public use in the church sor
all the books of Scripture. The reader will find in so small a book as this,
