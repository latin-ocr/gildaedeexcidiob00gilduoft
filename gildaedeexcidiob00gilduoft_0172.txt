(3) The words in 7103*er ordine cannot but refer to the ordo of monks,
implying also that the writer is himselfa monk, one of these very clerici. Had
he intended 3 reference to any one of the three 61611631 orders, he would have
used guazzius, as 116, 111 fact, does in c. 66. Jerome, in a terribly severe chapter
of his Ep. (ccl Eustocln’usn, says, almost anticipating the diatribes of Gildas :
‘⁸ Sunt alii, dc mei ordinis hominibus loquor, qui ideo presbyteratum et diaconatum
ambiunt, ut muliereslicentius videant’⁷ (Ep. 22, 28). Monks, of course, as such
were laymen; the great movement was originally a lay movement. I may
mention an exhaustive account by Dr. (3111121113611611θ of early monasfficism, in
which he has embodied conclusions derived from the Coptic sources published
in the Annales dcc llsztsc'e Guz’met (Tome xxii, Paris), as well as from Greek and
Latin writers. He shows how Pachomius insisted that even presbyters who
joined his discipline must, as members of his community‚ be laymen. He
monachized the clergy‚ thereby preparing the way for clericizing the monks.
During the age preceding that in which Gildas was born, many of 1116» most
influential men of &Vestem Christianity were 6161165 11131 had been trained as
monks. After describing the life observed in the monastery over which
St. Martin of Tours presided, Sulpicius Severus adds: “A great number of
them we see afterwards as bishops ; for what city or church was there, which
did not wish to have its priest (z'.e., bishop) from the monastery ofMartinus''
<Vim Asara, 10). Ε1161161· 3150, describing the southern centre of monasticism,
on the island of Lerins, exclaims : “that worthy island which rears distinguished
monks, and produces active, eager priests '⁵ (De Laude Eremi, 42). Copious
evidence to the same effect may be read in Arnold's cassarius von Arles, 41, n.
This fresh invigorating flood of new life could not fail to find its way to
Britain ; the previous age, upon the memory of which Gildas longingly dwells,
may have been due to men in the ministry ofthe Church, who had experienced
the elevation in which such men as Eucher exulted. The earliest instance that Ι
6311 find of such a monk-bishop in Britain, is a friend of Faustus, the third abbot
of Lerins, who was liimselfa Briton. Faustus was abbot of the monastery of
Lerins from 433 to 460, and afterwards bishop of Riez (civitas Regiensis) until
1115 death about 495. Apollinaris Sidonius, from whom we have an inter-
esting¹ account of the British lady that was Faustus’ mother, relates also, how
Faustus sent two of his writings to Britain by the hands osa sellow-countryman,
Riocatus. This Riocatus is styled bishop and monk—‹zntz'stes ac monachus
(111011. Hisl. Germ„ viii, 157). Η6 must havehad many comrades and successors
in that double capacity.

The oldest Welsh Vitae, or Lives of Saints, 3 few of which may (late from a
very early period, such 35 Vita Samsonis (Amzl. Bollandizzmz), represent these
men as abbots and bishops : they were probably the originators of the Weish
llzm, which, as the author of the Vita Pauli Leonensis explains it, means
monastery (Lanam Pauli, sd est, umnaslerium Pauli). Such were Dewi Sant,
Samson, l‘aul Aurelian, Maclovius (St. Malo), Dubricius, Teilo and others : a
large number of 1116 “ 5311115” (τ111011κ5 111 Wclsh hagiography) who crossed to
