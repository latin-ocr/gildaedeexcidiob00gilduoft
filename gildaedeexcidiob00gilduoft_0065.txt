In this 11 a) the time was diawing nigh when the iniquities of the Q
country, as those of the Amorites of old, would be fulfilled. Al

council is held, to deliberate what means ought to be determined

5upon, as the best and safest to repel such fatal and frequent

irruptions ancl plunderings by the nations mentioned above.
At that time all members of the assembly, along with the proud
tyrant, are blinded ; such is the protection they find for their

 

coming of the Saxons at the invitation of the Britons. It cannot, however,
be very long after the time clearly surnished by the third consulship of
Aetius (Agitio ter consuli, c. 20). This being in ΑΛ). 446, the approximate
dates given by Beda seem to be derived from it, though he connects the time
of the settlement os the Saxons with certain imperial events. A full note by
the Editor of M H. B„ p 120, collects the different dates assigned by Beda.
They are, 452 in the Chronica, 449 111 the sttomz (i, 15; v. 24), 447 iinpliecl in
i, 23, and v, 233 other parts suggest 448. The Chronicle, however, does
not fix the date to any given year, and the adverb 6“”ινιῑί1ν 15 added in the other
places. We learn from Gildas all that Beda knew. About 446 the Britons gain
the victory which causes the grassatores Hiberm' to fiee homewa1·ds‚but only to
return at no long interval (post non longum temporis reversuri) ; to meet that
return the Saxons are invited to come, and we rnay be well satisfied that no
nearer date can be found than 6. 447. The Gallic Chronicle of the year 511
(printed in M. Germania· Hz‘st„ vol. ix, p. 660), opposite ΑΙ). 441-442, gives:
Brittania usqae ad hoc tempas variis cladibus eventibusque latae in dl'cl'onmz
Sam-mmm redzjgrzmtur. (Mommsen conjectures late vexatae). Itis difficult to
reconcile this difference of five years, unless a Saxon invasion of that time be
regarded as one (perhaps the worst) os those which had made the Britons sear
the Saxons “ more than death.''

The Historia Britomtm follows a different tradition : it is to the effect that
the three ships which brought Horsa and Hengist came as the ships of exiles
(enpalsae in exilio).

Cyulz's or ciulz's, as the word is in X, must be the same as the English keel.
