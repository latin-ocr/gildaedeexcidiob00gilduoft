The Life of Gildas. 365

God, as he wished all to lead a peaceful life, went to the sea-shore.
There, bending his knees to the earth, he, with the saints that
adhered to him, earnestly prayed to the merciful Lord, who makes
all things He willeth in heaven and earth. On rising from his

s prayer, the saint pressed a staff which he was carrying in his hand,
against the ground, and thus walked round the court of his oratory.
O! lzow good thou art, tlzon God of Israel, emto tlzem tlmt are o Psalms xlviii,
an upwgrlzt laeart to leee. For, at the command of God, a fountain 1*
of sparkling water sprang from the spot on which the holy man

10 had prayed ; and, to mark beyond dispute the boundary line ofthe
court, it followed the footsteps of the saint. On hearing of this
miracle, believers, even some who behold this up to the present
time, return no small thanks to the Almighty Lord, who works
wonders through his saints.

28 Now, when the merciful God determined to lead St. Gildas from
the toils and cares of this life to the eternal joys which He has
promised unto them that love Him, it seemed good to Him to
announce it through an angel in a vision. For, when indeed he was,
as the ancients assert, in Horata, an island which he loved, where

20 formerly he had lived a hermit's lise, there appeared to him in a
dream, on a certain night, an angel of the Lord, saying: Heczrken

29 Now, when the morning was corne, and he had called his
disciples together, he said unto them : “ Since, my beloved sonS‚ IIKings ii, 2.

33 that Ι may be able to see God. Be ye, therefore, imilators of pff, v, 1, 2,
