15. If a certain work is imposed upon any man, and he, in
contempt, omits to do that work, let him go without his dinner, if

from real forgetfulness, he will have half his daily share of food.
16. But if he undertake the work of another, let him make that

5 known to the Abbot with modesty‚ in the hearing of no one except

the Abbot‚ and let him perform it if commanded.

17. For he who retains anger in his heart a long time, is in death.
But if ᾖε confess his sin, let him fast sorty dayS, and if ᾖε persist
further in his sin, two quadragesimae, and if he commit the same

10 sin, let him be cut off from the body as a decayed member, because

anger nourishes homicide.

18. Is a man is offended by anyone‚ he ought to make this
known to the Abbot, not with the feeling of an accuser, but of one
desiring to heal‚ and let the Abbot decide.

19. Who csoes not meet at the finishing [of the second Psalm],
let him sing eight Psalms in order; if, when roused, he comes in

 

would also agree well with the words of Dr. Stokes in his explanation of
cosmail, the Irish term for confirmation, as being derived from consumnmlio
(Trtparlz'te Life of Sl. Palrz'clc, p. 662). The present rule had its origin (and
the same might be said of the provision in c. 43 of the Regula of St. Benedict)
in the directions given by John Cassian: “He who, at Tierce, Sext, or
None, has not come to prayer before [lle Psalm begam is ended, does not
venture further to enter the oratory, or to join himself with those singing the
Psalms, but waits the breaking up of the congregation, standing outside, until
with lowly penance to the ground, as all go out, he obtain pardon for his
neglect and lateness⁷' (Inslz't. lib„ iii, 7).

4 Post misam = post missam 3 mz'sa appears as a reading in several Celtic

documents. Besides its ordinary meaning as a name for the Eucharistic service,
missa is at times employed in the sense of lectio, or Iesson, of Scripture. In
the Regula of Caesarius of Aries, who died about 542, or about the time
when Gildas was writing his De Excidio, we find c. 20 directing that there
were to be three readz'trgfs of the Scriptures (saciant el tres missas); froin
Aurelian of Arles, who died 530, are quoted, in reference to the reading in
public worship, the words, “ facite sex missas de Isaia propheta . . . . legantur
sex missae de evangelio” (Rietschel, Lehrbuclz der Lz'lztng⁴z'd',1,s. 350). This
meaning seems far more appropriate here than the common one that would
imply a celebration of the mass, and is confirmed by the reference to a second
missa, which in this sense refers to the second lesson read after the Psalnis
had been sung.

It may be also that missa is here the equivalent of coltszcslzmalz'o itself‚
with the well-known meaning of “endingss' as in the well-known ile, missa

est z go, the end is come.
