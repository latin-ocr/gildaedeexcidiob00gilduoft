way dying. For the souls of sinners are as immortal for never-
ending fire as those of the saints are sor joy.
33 And thou, the island dragon, who hast driven many of the
tyrants mentioned previously, as well from life as from kingdom,
5thou last in my writing, first in wickedness, exceecling many in
power and at the same time in malice, more liberal in giving, more
excessive in sin, strong in arms, but stronger in what destroys thy
soul—thou Maclocunus, why dost thou obtuse‘ly wallow in such an
old black pool of crimes, as if sodden with the wine that ῖς pressed Deus. xxxii‚32.
10fl'071l tlte vine of §odom P Why dost thou tie to thy royal neck
(of thine own accord, as I may say), such heaps, impossible to
remove, of crimes, as of high mountains? Why showest thou thy-
sels to Him, the King of all kingS, who made thee superior to
almost all the kings of Britain, both in kingdom and in the form
15 of thy stature, not better than the rest in morality, but on the
contrary worse P Give a patient hearing for awhile to an undoubted
record of those charges which, passing by domestic and lighter
offences—if, indeed, any are light—shall testify only 1116 things
which have been proclaimed far and wide, in broad daylight, as
20 admitted crimes. ln the first years of thy youth, accompanied by
soldiers of the bravest, whose countenance in battle appeared not
very unlike that of young lionS, didst thou not most bitterly crush
thy uncle the king with sword, ancl spear, and fire? Not regarding

consequences as haye followed werenot to occur, when He likewise

116 edits in the [Carme Gallique (1896), but gives in brackets those of other
Annals. Now the Tigernachian Annals say : A‘. VII. Marmlsms anagnu, which
means that it occurred duringa year in which the Kalends, or Ist osJanuary‚
was a Saturday. The Annals of Ulster place it in 551, those of Inisfallen in
541 (Rev. Cels„ p. 140). Not one of the three Irish documents agrees quite
with the Weish, but the errors cannot be important in any. We therefore
adopt 547 as the approximate date of Maelgwns death. But, as he was alive
when Gildas wrote, it has been rightly concluded that the De Eia-idio must
have been written before 547. On the whole question of date, see Introduction.

Insulam draco is explained in Celtic Britain as iinplying that “island'’
is Britain itself‚ not Mona. When we reflect that “euagon'’ is the last of the
opprobrious epithets—cur, whelp, leopard, bear, dragon—applied to the five
kings, one is drawn to the belief that even the insularis is also intended to wound.
If so, the reference must be to Maelgwn in his island home, Mona.
