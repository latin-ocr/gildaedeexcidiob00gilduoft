lee Lz'fe of Gildas. 347

16 When he was afterwards making arrangements to return to
his own country, God, who willed to magnis& His mercy zmto ns Lle. i, 53·
would not permit him to do SO. For when, at God's command,
he had come to Armorica—formerly a territory in Gaul, but it was

5 at that time called Letavia by the Bretons, in whose possession it
was—he was received by the inhabitants with honour and great
joy. But he himself, while shunning worldly and vanishing
honours, was longing more and more to lead a life of contem-
plation. At that time, however, the resources of the kings and

10 kingdom of the Franks were small. For in those days, as any
wise reader can learn from the histories of the ancients, it was
Childericus, the son of Meroveus, a man devoted to the error of
the heathen, that was ruling over the Franks. St. Gildas, therefore,
in the thirtieth year of his age, came to some island which lay in

 

Clovis, who reigned from 511 to 558, or Clzilpericus, son of Chlotochar,
and grandson of Clovis, whose reign extended from 562 to 584. The Hislom'a
Francormn by Gregory of Tours introduces Meroveus in these words : “⁶ Mero-
vechum regem fuisse adserunt, cuius fuit filius Clzz'ldem‘cus (ii, 9). This
Childeric was the father of Chlodovech, or, as the name is generally written,
Clovis‚ who succeeded him in 481 3 Clovis again had four sons, among whom
his kingdom was divided after his death, viz„ Chlotochar l, Childebert I,
Theuderic 1, and Chlodomer. For three years the kingdom was united under
Chlotochar 1, but on his death was again divided among his four sons,
Charibert, Gunthram, Chilperic and Sigibert (Hz'sl. Fr„ iv, 22). Gildas' later
life might have been contemporary with Childebert or Chilperic, but when
we remember that these two were Christian and Catholic kings, while the
king whom our biographer had in mind was, as he represents him, a heathen
(gentilimn errori deditus), we can only conclude that he meant the Childericus
who died in 481. He, as the son of Meroveus and father of Clovis, it is easily
known, was a heathen king, but had been dead many years before the birth
of Gildas. Besides the mention of his being a heathen, the expression tunc
temporisparva res, in reference to “the kingdom of the Franks,'⁷ can only apply
to a time anterior to the conquests of Clovis. Our biographer, I conclude, is
drawing upon his imagination, and has fallen into error.

3 Gildas trigy'nla habens annos. According to this account, Gildas migrated
to Armorica when he was thirty years of age. 1 may refer to the notes on pp
62, 64, and 156 of the De Excidio, where Ι believe the right conclusion is
drawn, that Gildas had not, when he wrote that work, retired as fully as he

⁴ intended from the struggles of an active life: seclusion was as yet some-
thing to belonged for when he was in the forty-fourth year of his age. The
visit to Ireland, by many indications, must be placed in the sixties of the sixth
century, while the years spent by several Irish saints, such as Finian and
Brendan, with Gildas and Dewi at Kil-muine (St. David's)‚ suppose alengthened
stay in his native country either before or after that visit. Gildas, therefore,
cannot have emigrated to Brittany before the evening of his days. Here
