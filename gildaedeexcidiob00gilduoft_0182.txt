non dicam apostolo Petr0, sed cuilibet sancto sacerdoti pioque regi1
ingesta fuisset, cadem responsa accepissent, quae ab apostolo
auctor eorundem magus Simon dicente Petro: Pecunia tna lecum
sit z'n perditionem. Sed forte heu, qui ambitores istos ordinant,
immo potius humiliant atque pro benedictione maledicunt, dum ex
peccatoribus non paenitentes, quod rectius fuerat, sed sacrilegos
et desperatos faciunt et Iudam quodammodo in Petri cathedra
domini traditorem ac Nicolaum2 in loco Stephani martyris statu-
unt inmundae haereseos adinventorem, eodem modo sacerdotio
adsciti sunt: et ideo non magnopere detestantur in filiis, quin
immo venerantur, quod similiter ut patribus subinde venisse cer-
tissimum est.

Etenim eos, si in parochiam,3 resistentibus sibi et tam pretiosum

 

1 Cuilibet sancto sacerdote pioque regi. The words point out the personages
to whom the offer of money might be made, to a bishop or a king. Below, we

are told that the men drawn by ambition to simony were ordained by others
who had obtained the priesthood in the same way.

² Nicolaum. Gildas probably borrowed the baseless fiction implied in
this place from Rufinus’ Latin translation of Eusebius (H. E., iii, 29). ‘⁶ The
author of their sect (Nicolaitans) was Nicolaus, one of the deacons, who, with
Stephen were appointed by the apostles sor the purpose of ministering to the
poor.'' Apparently, all accounts go back to a conjecture made by Irenaeus
(Adv. Haer„ i, 26, 3), who probably knew no more about the Nicolaitans than he
read in Rev. ii, 6, 15. He may have been the first to identify their founder
with the Nicolaus of Acts vi. Clement of Alexandria, who was the recipient of
many curious traditions respecting the men and facts of the Apostolic age,
seems to have held a very different opinion (Βίωνι, iii, 4, 25). A similar disin-
clination to connect Nicolaus with any such sect holding immoral tenets may
be detected in Cellsl. Aposloll‘crle‚ vi, 8, οἶ νῦν ψευδώνυμοι Νικολιιῖτιιι. By GildaS’
time, however, the false belief had become universal.

³ ln parochiam=in parochia. We have already met with instances of in
with accus. denoting place where, and referred to Ronsch, Itala u. Vulgata, 410,
for a host of examples of the same. parochia must mean see, or diocese, that is,
church. In the previous section the utter neglect of those who obtained by money
the priest's chair, to undertake the charge symbolized in that throne, is described
by the phrase that “they never sat therein ⁷² (qui ibidem nusquam sederunt). N ow
we have presented us the other picture, of bishops who, aster similar pelf,
would thrust themselves upon a church (parochia), but encounter opposition.
The two ternis parochia and dioecesis have had a curious history: both are
originally abstract, but, like the equally abstract “circumcision '⁷ (ἡ περιτομὴ)
in the New Testament, soon acquired a concrete meaning. The two also are
originally Greek (παροικία, διοίκησις), but as we meet with them in Latin, they
are applied, without distinction, both to a church under the oversight of a
bishop and, at a later period, to a church of which a presbyter has charge,
subject to the neighbouring bishop. Sulpicius Severus, writing of St. Martin
