Hebrew as its original (mm as a Heb. pl. ending z -im)‚ just as cherubz'ms is
often written in ordinary English.

(b) VVords of which a Semitic origin may be assumed with a measure ofproba—
bility z (1) patham, v. 39 ; the Hebrew may be pssalz or p’atlz (peith), apparently
sometimes denoting levzples‚· the Syriacpzitltci has at times the meaningsoreltead.
(2) Carsum, v. 40 K reads clmmssum, C N crassum ,· the Irish gloss gives pecta&
another gloss is velllremj we have also breost(b1·east>. The nearest Hebrew
is hares = belly, which occurs once (Jer. li, 34), but is usual in Syriae and
cognates. (3) Cladum v. 40, K reads chalucium, C cladam‚· as the possible
original of this word we have the Syriac ὸσιιιίία by metathesis ; there is in this
case no corresponding Hebrew, and the probability is consequently much
reduced. (4) mandianum, v. 4ο, C, N, K read madianium (cf. anllzletas in C
for athletas, v. 22) 3 the Heb rew may be mathmzim = loins. The word is never
used as a singular, and -um is thus for Heb. pl. -z'm.

(c) VVords in which the resemblance to Semitic originals is slight. (ngssgram
or as C, gygram, v. 38 3gugras is glossated capita = lteads in Luxemb. Frag.
The only Hebrew that would answer to the gloss (skull) is golgoletlz ,· gargar =
necle, is nearer, but then the gloss is against it. (2) iaris, v. 38, the Hebrew sear
or saar = lcair, presents too slight a resemblance. (3) comte, v. 38, glossated
eyes in Lorica and Luxemb. Frag.‚ may be from ‘ain or Ἕκ, but in such a
word ‘ is never transliterated g. (4) E.2·ugicun‚ v. 41, is un-Semitic. (5) Micenas
might be a Semitic form.

¹ Vibrent iacula. In the De Excidio, c. 76, we have librent iacula, which is
also the reading here of C, N, Κ.
² Lz‘gycam, possibly the same as linguam. Ν reads lzgranam, and so C 3 the

gloss is jungam. Cf. Sweet‚ Oldest English Texts, p. 171. But we have the
same two again below, v. 50, dentibus lingue, though in inverse order.
