support in some ancient writers. Orosius describes the tyrannus as a man of
strong character and probity, worthy to be Augustus, but created emperor
against lais will (in Britannia invitus propemodum ab exercitu imperator
creatus, Hist„ vii, 34.) Zosimus dwells upon the unpopularity of Gratian at the
time among the soldiery, owing· to the favour shown by him to the barbarian
Alani (τοῦτο τοῖς στρατιώταις κατὰ τοῦ βασιλέως ἔτεκε μῖσος, Hl'sl. Nova, iv, 35).
“ It is possible that he (Maximus) was rather the instrument than the author of
the mutiny’' (Hodgkin's Italy and Her lnvaders, i, 401). Now this is exactly
the implication of Gildas' language : mm legl'lime, sed rillc tyrannico el slmmlszt
(mle im'tmtmn milite, Alczxz'lnmn llll'l‘fl'l‘ ( Brl'fanm'a).

Maximus crossed over into Gaul, taking with him the greater part of three
legions : with these and the forces which joined him on the continent, he was
able soon to make himself master of almost the whole of Europe west of Italy.

The further words of Gildas, which describe this progress, show that he-was

writing this part also of his narrative with a firm grasp of the real facts of the
tlrne.

He gives prominence to cunning artfulness (callida ars), to perjury and
falsehood, on the part of Maximus, which unamiable features of his character
are amply attested by writers of the fourth and fifth centuries. Socrates
describes the guile by which the young emperor Gratian was captured and
murdered (Γρατιανὸς δόλῳ τοῦ τυράννου Μαξίμου ἀνῄρητο, Η. E., v, II) 3 SOZOIDGH
speaks of the specious pretext he advanced that he would “allow no innovation
to be introduced with respect to the national faith and church 01-der.²⁷ Mr.
Hodgkin, in narrating· the meeting· of the two armies, that of Maximus and
Merobaudes, Gratian⁷s counsellor and general, adds: “For five days there

were slight and indecisive skirmishes, but during all this time Maximus and his
right-hand man, Andragathius, the commander of his cavalry, were tampering·
with the fidelity of Gratian⁷s troops.⁷⁷ At a later time, when Theodosius was
making his preparations to suppress him, aided by the Gothic scwdomli, the
man of whom Gildas speaks with such sincere reprobation is thus described by
the same historian : ‘⁶ Indeed, Maximus, whose one idea of strategy seems to
have been to bribe the soldiers of his opponent, had actually entered into
negotiations with some of the barbarians, offering them large sums ofmoney if
they would betray their master⁷' (lsaly and Hes lnwzdcrs, i, 403, 465). Gildas
fixes our attention upon Maximus because through him, the second stage of
“the evils suffered ⁷² by Britain, begins in a highly aggravated form. But he
may have felt also that this usurper, in whose usurpation Britain had a guilty
share, had been a prominent figure in history. Ambrose of Milan gives an
account of two embassies to him, in which the wily Maximus found the great
bishop too astute for him ; he is spoken of in the writings of Zosimus, of the
ecclesiastical historians Socrates and Sozomen, of Jerome, Augustine, Orosius
and Sulpicius Severus, probably others, besides several Chronica and Annales.
after reaching Italy in 387, and Rome itself early in 388, the energy of
Theodosius the Great brings his career to an end ; he was captured and put to
deati. “at the third milestone from Aquileia⁷³ on August zssth (Prosper
Tiro, Clzron„ and Socrates, H. E, v, 14).

It is only now that Gildas, for the first time, mentions the Picts and Scots,
old enemies though they had been, becausefirsl, Britain was guilty of the old
sin of unfaithfulness, and secomz’ly, because not until then had the barbarians
