ΙΙ. RESPECTING ABSTINENCE FROM FooDs GILDAs sAvs:

5 Abstinence from fleshly foods without love is profitless Better Ι Tim. iv. 4·
therefore are those who fast without great display, and do not
beyond measure abstain from what God has created, but anxiously Psalms i, 12.
prcservea clean heart within (from which they know is the issue
of life), than those who refuse to eat flesh or delight themselves in

10 worldly foodS‚ who ride not in vehicles and on horseback, and Jer. ix. 21.
because of these things regard themselves as superior to others
To these men death enters by the windows of pride.

Ὗ ΧἮἹΕΠ we compare Cyprian⁷s full quotation ofthis passage (De Cath. Unit„ 16),

and Lucifer’s‚ who so frequently agrees with Gildas in uncommon readings, we
s find a striking diversity of rendering. For instabunt tenzpora pessima Lucifer has
Ἴ adveniunt ; Cyprian has aderunt t. molesta ; he also reads sibi placentes, superbi,
Α tumidi, cupidi . . . . parentibus in dicto non audientes . . . . delatores . . . . bonum
non anzantes . . . . voluptates magis quam Deum diligentes, habentes deforma-
tionem religionis. Again, Jerome himself knew of Gildas’ pessima, which he
‘- quotes (Soph. ii), according to Tischendorf's critical notes. We have, thus, in
⁴ this remarkable piece of the Old Latin Bible used in Britain, another proof that

middle-aged people, about A.D. 540, were familiar with two versions, and very

closely intimate with the older.

4 Zelum Dei, Old Latin, literal for ζῆλον θεοῦ. Vulgate, denudationem Dei.
