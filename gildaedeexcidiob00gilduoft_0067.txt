The Ruin os Bm'tam. 55

country (it was, in fact, its destruction) that those wild Saxons,
of accursed name, hated by God and men, should be admitted
into the island, like wolves into folds, in order to repel the northern
nations. Nothing more hurtful, certainly, nothing more bitter,
happened to the island than this. What utter depth of darknt‘ss
of soul! What hopeless and cruel dulness of mind! The men
whom, when absent, they feared more than death, were invited by s
them of their own accord, so to say, under the cover osone roofxl

10 Then there breaks forth a brood of whelps from the lair of the] 13'

savage lioness, in three cyulae (keels), as it is expressed in their
language, but in ours, in ships of war under full sail, with omens and
divinationS. In these it was foretold, there being a prophecy firmly
relied upon among them, that they should occupy the country to
15 which the bows of their ships were turned, for three hundred years ;
sor one hundred and fifty—that is for half the time—they should
make frequent devastationS. They sailed out, and at the directions
of the unlucky tyrant, first fixed their dreadful talons in the eastern
part os the island, as men intending to fight for the country, but

’ 20 more truly to assail it. To these the mother of the brood, finding

that success had ·attended the first contingent, sends out also a
larger raft-full of accomplices and curs, which sails over and joins
itself to their bastard comradeS. From that source, the seed
of iniquity, the root of bitterness, grows as a poisonous plant,
25 worthy of our desertS, in our own soil, furnished with rugged
branches and leaves Thus the barbarians, admitted into the
island, succeed in having provisions supplied them, as if they were
soldiers and about to encounter, as they falsely averred, great hard-
ships for their kind entertainers. These provisionS, acquired for a
30 length of time, closed, as the saying is, the dog's maw. They com-
plain, again, that their monthly supplies were not copiously con-
tributed to them, intentionally colouring their opportunities, and
declare that, if larger munificence were not piled upon them, they
would break the treaty and lay waste the whole of the island.
35 They made no delay to follow up their threats with deedS.

Greeks. οἱ ἄρχοντες Τάνεως = princes os Zoan. Jerome did not revert to the
Hebrew name in revising the Latin here.
