he also was the meekest of all tlte men of that time. He was
moreover, wise both in his teaching and in action, truthful in
conversation, dilzgent in prayers, continuing through the nights in
watchings, torturing his body with fastings‚ long—suffering in
§wrongs, affable in conference, bountiful in alms, distinguished in

after the first and second reproot] should be avoided ; and, in his
sermons, he exhorted men to atone for sins by alms, to seed the

hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the naked‚to visit the
10 sick and those cast into prison, to bury the dead, to return evil for
evil to no man, to love sasting, to be always assiduous in watchings

the apostles and the prophets, and then recalling them to penitence‚
he would confidently promise that, provided they sincerely

19 Once more: the holy man, at the request of brother monks
who had come to him from Britain, ten years after he had
departed from the country, wrote a short epistolary book, in
which he reproved five of the kings of that island who had been
30 ensnared by various crimes and sins Ι have, therefore, thought it
proper to add on this page a few words to show how elegantly and
how concisely he has related their worthlessness, and censured
each of them by name for his iniquitieS. For, osa trutll, says he, segg-a, 1³1³·65
